# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Political-Tweets and News Coverage

This is an R code for a research project i conducted for my MA thesis. In this project I conduct a sentiment analysis of political tweets, as well as news media coverage of local gun policy. The R code shows the steps I followed in order to measure common themes and frames in both the political tweets and the news articles. It also demonstrates the sentiment meeasurement method, which includes emotions and polarity, as well as sentiment over time.
This repository includes the original data utilized in this project, and images of plots and charts.
