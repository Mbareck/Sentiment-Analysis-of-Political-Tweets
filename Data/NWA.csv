"Collins, Garner differ on guns, other issues","FAYETTEVILLE - No member of the Northwest Arkansas delegation inspired more protests during the last legislative session than Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville. His legislation a l l ows concealed carry permit holders to take weapons onto state college campuses if they get extra training.

The House District 84 contest is about a lot more than Act 562 of 2017, though, said Collins and his Democratic opponent, Denise Garner of Fayetteville.

""At every meet and greet I go to, the first thing that comes up is guns,"" Garner said. ""The real issue is that Charlie didn't listen, not to faculty or staff, students or parents or the campus police."" On any issue, she said, Collins has an opinion of his own and sticks to it.

Collins said his record is a wide, varied and influential; one that benefits residents of his district in particular and Arkansas in general.

""I don't just flap my gums and make promises,"" Collins said. ""On taxation, education, regulation and litigation I've reduced barriers for my constituents and their children to succeed.""

In particular, he is ""laser focused on income tax policy"" in the upcoming legislative session, Collins said. Criticism of the governor's

plan to reduce taxes on the most successful Arkansans in the upcoming session ignores tax cuts already passed that benefit Arkansas in lower income brackets, he said.

District 84 stretches from northern West Fork to southern Springdale. It takes in the eastern side of Fayetteville but does not include the grounds of the University of Arkansas, where Collins' gun legislation stirred the most protest. Early voting in the Nov. 6 general election begins Monday.

On health care, Collins said the support of conservative lawmakers like him was vital to getting the state's innovative health care plan passed in 2013 and renewing it in subsequent years.

""I was in the room when we got the variances we needed from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that allowed it,"" Collins said. He supports the work requirements and other reforms added to the program since, he said.

Yet Collins was one of the few lawmakers who, in the last session, did not vote in favor of a bill that reined in pharmacy benefits managers, Garner said. House Bill 1010 of 2018 passed in a special session after pharmacists across the state protested that certain suppliers were getting favorable treatment.

Garner also criticized state grants Collins steered to Ecclesia College, a private religious school in Springdale that was later found to have given kickbacks to lawmakers who made bigger grants. Collins was never implicated in the kickback scheme. Collins said he supported Ecclesia's work college concept, which allows students to get a college degree without incurring a lot of loan debt. Work study colleges allow students to work off much of their tuition.

As a director of nonprofit efforts, Garner said, she will foster a more cooperative approach if elected. ""Democracy doesn't work if everybody doesn't participate,"" she said.

State House members serve two-year terms and have an annual salary of $39,400.

"Collins, Garner spar over ethics","FAY E T T EV I L L E - State House District 84 rivals sparred over ethics Tuesday, with challenger Denise Garner criticizing a loan incumbent Rep. Charlie Collins made to a fellow legislator.

That 2016 loan was fully disclosed in financial records two years ago and never came up until ethics controversies involving other legislators came up this year, Collins replied.

The two candidates met in a forum beginning at 7 p.m. Tuesday, hosted by

the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce and held at the Fayetteville Public Library. A standing-room-only crowd of 100 packed the meeting room. Collins is a Republican and Garner is a Democrat.

On Monday both state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and her Democratic challenger, Mike Lee, called for a ban on loans from any Arkansas lawmaker to another. This announcement came after the

Arkansas Democrat-Gazette

disclosed a previously unreported loan from Rep. Joe Jett, R-Success, to the House Speaker at the time, former Rep. Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, of $16,000. Gillam amended his financial disclosure on Friday.

Rutledge and Lee's calls for a ban were reported Tuesday. ""Now just today we find that my opponent was skating on thin ethics ice,"" Garner said at the forum.

""Your own Republican attorney general says the practice should be illegal,"" Garner said of the loan. ""Giving it shows poor judgment and a lack of transparency.""

Collins retorted that transparency was complete because he reported the loan to thenstate Rep. Nate Bell, an independent from Mena, on his state financial interest disclosure form and never attempted to conceal it. He said the practice only became controversial in the wake of the scandal involving state General Improvement Fund grants and other practices. The federal investigation into those grants, Medicaid fraud, bribery and related issues have resulted in convictions of five former state lawmakers so far. Collins has not been implicated.

Collins reported a loan of more than $12,500 to Nate and Phyllis Bell in 2016, his financial interest statement shows, and receiving more than $1,000 in interest on a loan to the couple. On his report for 2017, Collins reported a loan of more than $1,000 but less than $12,500 to Nate and Phyllis Bell and receiving interest income of more than $1,000 on a loan to the couple. Phyllis Bell is an aide to Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

""She knew about it,"" Collins said of Garner. ""She has people reading my financial interest reports. The loan was common knowledge.""

Garner also questioned Collins award of some state General Improvement Fund to Ecclesia College in Springdale. That college's former president was sentenced to three years in federal prison earlier this month for paying kickbacks in returns for grants from two other legislators. Collins was not implicated. However, Garner said it showed bad judgment to make grants to a college outside his district. Collins replied that Ecclesia, a work-study college with low tuition, offered an affordable option for a college degree for students living in his district and elsewhere.",9/26/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"JPs advance concealed carry proposal - Handgun ordinance affects county officials, employees","Concealed carry 

Benton County's justices of the peace approved the first reading of an ordinance allowing elected officials and county employees to carry concealed handguns in some county offices. The ordinance will be read for the second time at the Quorum Court's July 26 meeting and if approved on its second reading will be read for the third and final time at the Quorum Court's Aug. 23 meeting.

Source: Staff report

BENTONVILLE - Benton County's justices of the peace on Thursday endorsed allowing elected officials and county employees to carry concealed handguns in some county buildings, but not without some disagreement.

The Quorum Court approved the first reading of an ordinance allowing elected officials and employees to carry concealed handguns in buildings where possession isn't prohibited by federal or state laws. The ordinance must be read at three Quorum Court meetings before it's enacted.

Thursday's vote was 13 in favor and one against. Susan Anglin, justice of the peace for District 9, cast the lone dissenting vote. Anglin said she doesn't believe the county has done enough to answer questions the ordinance could raise. She said she would like to have information on the effect the ordinance might have on liability insurance and possible workmen's compensation claims. She said the county should also look into conflict resolution training for officials and employees.

""I just didn't feel there was a clear-cut reason to support it,"" Anglin said. ""We haven't really discussed a lot of the issues that can come up.""

Before the justices of the peace discussed the ordinance they heard another voice opposing the ordinance. Amy Gillespie, of Bella Vista, said during the public comment period of the meeting she opposes the ordinance and she urged the justices of the peace to reject it.

Gillespie, with the Bentonville group of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, said the ""good guy with a gun stopping a bad guy with a gun"" is ""a myth, a talking point, and factually wrong."" She cited a number of studies of gun violence that make counter arguments and pointed to numerous accidents and incidents of carelessness involving guns in public places.

Gillespie said after the meeting she was disappointed in the vote to put the ordinance on a second reading and on track for possible approval in two months.

""I feel this proposal was not well-researched in advance,"" she said.

Other justices of the peace had few questions or comments. Joel Edwards, justice of the peace for District 15, said the Benton County Sheriff's Office has offered to make ""active shooter"" training available for employees and elected officials.

Pat Adams, justice of the peace for District 6, said possible problems with emotional or angry employees can be handled as they can now, by calling the Sheriff's Office for assistance. He also said Benton County is an ""at-will"" employer, giving elected officials and department heads all the authority they need to handle employees.

""That is one piece of the pie,"" Adams said, ""but I don't know if it's critical enough to delay this legislation.""

Arkansas law on concealed handguns prohibits permit holders from carrying weapons in a number of places. The list begins with ""any police station, sheriff's station, or Department of Arkansas State Police station"" and includes highway police and Department of Transportation facilities and adjacent ground.

The list of prohibited places also includes ""any courthouse, courthouse annex, or other building owned, leased or regularly used by a county for conducting court proceedings or housing a county office."" The law provides exceptions for county employees, elected officials and justices of the peace if the Quorum Court approves allowing concealed carrying of handguns that is incorporated into the local security and emergency preparedness plan.

The law doesn't allow members of the public to have concealed handguns. County employees would be required to have the enhanced concealed carry permit to have handguns in those areas allowed by the ordinance.

The proposal still lists as prohibited places ""any place otherwise prohibited by federal or Arkansas law"" along with a courtroom; a facility housing any operation of the Benton County Sheriff, including the jail; the Benton County Juvenile Detention Facility; any building owned or leased by Benton County in which circuit or district court proceedings are held; any state office on property owned or leased by Benton County; a school, college, community college or university event.

County Judge Barry Moehring had an email survey sent to employees regarding security concerns and concealed carrying of handguns in county building. Email messages were sent to 682 employees and responses received from 253 employees.

More than 72 percent of those who responded said they feel safe in their county building. About 45 percent said they would feel safer if their building had a metal detector and screening station and about 25 percent said they wouldn't feel safer in a building with metal detectors. Nearly 30 percent said they now work in a building with metal detectors. When asked about their preference for guns in the workplace, more than 36 percent said it should be limited to police officers/sheriff 's deputies. Just under 40 percent said all employees should be allowed to have concealed weapons, and about 11 percent said everyone entering a county building should be allowed to carry a concealed handgun.

Moehring said the discussion of the concealed carry issue revived consideration of improving security for the County Administration Building, including installing a metal detector. He said the elected officials were unanimous in supporting that plan He said the initial cost estimate is about $60,000 to do the work on the building. Another $4,000 is needed to cover personnel costs through the end of the year.",6/29/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Gun law crops up at fiscal session - Two lawmakers want tweak; two others want ban in dorm rooms,"Lawmakers unhappy with some aspects of a 2017 law to create ""enhanced"" concealed-carry permits are planning to use the ongoing fiscal session to adopt the changes they say are needed.

The permits will allow gun owners to take their weapons into many public places, including college campuses.

On one side of the debate, supporters of the ""campus carry"" law, Act 562 of 2017, say the law just needs to be tweaked; some gun instructors spoke out against being required to teach ""enhanced"" courses or else lose their instructors' licenses.

Meanwhile, a pair of Democrats have signaled their intent to add language that would prohibit concealed weapons in college dormitories, which they said was the original intent of Act 562.

To even consider non-appropriation bills during the fiscal session will require approval of two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature.

The first pair of resolutions filed separately in the House and the Senate would allow consideration of a bill to let concealed carry instructors opt out of offering the ""enhanced"" permit course, which includes up to eight hours of additional training for permit holders. It also would replace the word ""nominal"" when describing the cost of the course with the word ""reasonable.""

Two Republicans - Sen. Trent Garner of El Dorado and Rep. Bob Ballinger of Hindsville - sponsored those resolutions.

On Twitter on Tuesday, Garner condemned the alternate proposal by two Democrats, Rep. Greg Leding of Fayetteville and Sen. Will Bond of Little Rock, to raise the issue of banning guns in dorm rooms.

""Looking at that proposal, it's a bad step back for Arkansas, it's a bad step back for Second Amendment rights and I think a majority of members do not support that,"" Garner said in an interview. ""My legislation they may.""

Bond said he would call for a vote on his resolution to bring up the issue of guns in dorms if Republicans attempted to bring up their own gun bills.

Republicans hold strong majorities of both the House and the Senate.

If no changes are made to the 2017 law, instructors who refuse to offer the new ""enhanced"" courses may be stripped of their teaching permits in about six months.

College students who obtain the enhanced carry permits may keep handguns in their dorm rooms as long as the weapons remain within arm's reach at all times, according to rules devised by the Arkansas State Police.

During the 2017 regular session, the bill that became the campus carry law was subject to much haranguing by critics, and it bounced back and forth between the Senate floor and the committee considering it.

Democrats complained that the law removed the ability of public universities - which all opposed allowing guns on their campuses - to set their own rules. Conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said requiring extra training went against the Second Amendment.

Garner said some Republicans remained skeptical about opening up the fiscal session, which is normally reserved for spending bills, to other issues. He said he was in talks with legislative leadership and the governor's office about raising the issue of guns during the session, which opened Monday.",2/14/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"Load'em up! - Training, licensing for 'enhanced' gun carry begins","Most likely, there are concealed-carry weapons on some of the state's college campuses today.

Not everyone welcomes an armed climate on campus, but the guns may be there lawfully - thanks to full implementation of a 2017 law pushed by state Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville.

Collins made enactment of this law a personal cause, pitching it to fellow lawmakers session after session.

Last year, he finally succeeded. He got strong help from the National Rifle Association and a conservative, Republican-majority Legislature.

What happens now is on him and on other supporters of the legislation that was quite literally forced on the state's institutions of higher learning.

The law applies only to the public colleges and universities, each of which officially opposed the measure when an earlier version of Collins' law allowed the governing boards of the institutions a say in the matter. The earlier law authorized concealed carry on campuses statewide but allowed each campus' board of trustees to opt out annually. Every institution of higher learning affected chose to opt out each year.

The newer version eliminated campus discretion. Now, if an eligible applicant gets an enhanced permit, he or she can carry a gun to class or anywhere else on campus where it is not specifically restricted.

Thankfully, there are at least some restrictions. Concealed carry will be forbidden, for example, at athletic events.

But the guns could be so many other places and in so many hands.

The concern isn't so much about the people who might be licensed to carry a weapon. There is at least a presumption that the state would not license them at all, much less grant them an enhanced license for concealed carry, if the individual applicants weren't properly trained.

The concern is about the unintended consequences of the presence of guns on campus and not necessarily just in the hands of people who are officially permitted to carry them.

A gun that gets to campus lawfully can be stolen or taken away by someone not permitted to have it. And then there are the potential gun-related accidents, involving even the best-intentioned actors.

Keep in mind that law enforcement people, with rare exception, opposed this law and many testified against it. They worry about active shooter situations and whether an assailant can be distinguished from other people with guns.

Charlie Collins' prime argument for concealed-carry weapons on a campus related to that same active shooter premise. He is convinced the possibility that anyone might be carrying a gun is enough to cause a potential shooter to stay away from that campus.

Regardless of the arguments for and against it, Collins' law is now in full effect - whatever the consequences.

Implementation did get delayed for a time while the Arkansas State Police designed a training program for concealed-carry license holders to get an ""enhanced"" permit to allow them to carry on campus and in some other places where they could not previously carry.

But the delays are over.

More than 70 Arkansas concealed-carry instructors are now trained to teach the enhanced curriculum.

And the recently trained trainers were expected to offer the required eight-hour training starting within the last couple of weeks.

A couple of them told reporters, as the trainers completed their own training, that they had waiting lists of gun owners wanting to secure the enhanced permits.

The trainers intended to offer single eighthour sessions, allowing applicants to qualify for their enhanced licenses the same day they start their training.

That surely happened in the week just past. The bulge under someone's jacket or the extra weight of a purse might just be a gun. Beware.",2/14/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Trainers certified under gun law - Concealed-carry classes set soon,"More than 70 Arkansas concealed-carry instructors began receiving certificates this week authorizing them to teach a new ""enhanced"" curriculum, and it will likely be this month that certified gun owners can take weapons to previously prohibited places such as bars, college campuses and the state Capitol.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday on Twitter that the first instructors were made eligible to offer enhanced concealed-carry training after taking tests last week.

Two of the instructors who passed the test said Wednesday that they planned to start offering the classes next week and already had lengthy waiting lists of gun owners. They said they planned to offer the class as a single eighthour session, allowing current concealed-carry licensees to apply for ""enhanced"" licenses the same day they start and complete their training.

Once they have their ""enhanced"" permits in hand, gun owners will be able to carry weapons in previously gun-free locations.

Meanwhile, those locations are putting the finishing touches on their plans to accommodate armed

citizens.

The University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, is operating with the stance that the new gun rules are ""fully implemented,"" university spokesman Mark Rushing said.

Previously, the campus banned firearms except for those carried by law enforcement officials. Now, students and faculty members who obtain the appropriate certification may carry concealed handguns to classes - though guns are still off limits at athletic events and in some buildings. He said signs are being put up making those rules clear.

""We don't know when the first permit holder will arrive on campus with a concealed handgun,"" Rushing said. ""Our message is [the law] is fully implemented.""

In Little Rock, signs have appeared on some public buildings warning that guns are still off limits, except to those with the required permits.

Officials at the Capitol, however, declined to say how security plans have changed.

The new strata of holders of concealed-handgun permits was created by Act 562 of 2017. The law was the result of a policy debate that took up much of last year's regular legislative session, as pro-gun lawmakers debated among themselves how far to go in expanding areas where Arkansans could legally carry guns.

B y co m pl e t i n g e i g h t hours of additional training, including two hours of livefire shooting, concealed-carry licensees can receive an endorsement on their cards allowing them to carry guns in many public places that had previously banned firearms.

The new law also has drawn consternation, not only among ""gun sense"" groups, but from some concealed-carry instructors who say there should be no training required to carry a gun into public places.

One holdout among the instructors was Jan Morgan, the Hot Springs gun store owner who said she will challenge Hutchinson in the Republican primary.

Morgan said in a statement that she was not planning to teach the enhanced concealed-carry class, calling the legislation a ""convoluted mess.""

Arkansas State Police rules require all of the state's roughly 1,000 concealed-carry instructors to become certified to teach the enhanced course within six months, or lose their teaching certification. Some lawmakers have proposed tweaking the law during this month's fiscal session to allow instructors to keep their certification if they don't teach the enhanced course.

""I think the number of those that are going to opt out or not take the course are probably in the minority,"" said Thomas DuPriest, an instructor at Shoothouse USA in Conway.

DuPriest said he plans to offer his first class on Feb. 8 to members of his range, and after that will open classes to the 300 people who have already signed up.

For $150, DuPriest said his course will include a 50-round ""warm-up"" before applicants attempt the 50-round shooting test. They'll have up to three attempts at the shooting test, he said, before they have to wait 90 days to take it again.

DuPriest said he did not think poor marksmanship would be an issue.

""The assumption is that you've shot before and stayed proficient,"" he said.

Another instructor planning to offer the course, Aaron Acklin of Little Rock, said he will offer private classes to individuals or small groups for around $140. Acklin said between 50 and 60 people have already signed up, and he plans to start with a ""small-knit group"" as soon as this weekend.

For the classroom portion of the course, Acklin says he plans to go more in-depth on the state-mandated subjects, such as nonviolent dispute resolution.

""These are state minimal requirements; they're not good enough,"" Acklin said.

Once an applicant has passed the course and submitted paperwork to the state police, the agency is prepared to issue the enhanced licenses, spokesman Liz Chapman said in an email.

At the Capitol, officials remained mum Wednesday when asked about their plans to accommodate lawmakers, staff members and tourists who carry concealed weapons. (During the same session in which lawmakers passed Act 562, they approved legislation exempting state Capitol security plans from public-records requests.)

The state Capitol police chief on Wednesday referred questions to the secretary of state's office, which manages the building and oversees the police. Chris Powell, a spokesman for Secretary of State Mark Martin, declined to give details of how police would screen for concealed weapons, or whether there were certain areas that will remain off limits, such as the House floor. The building has metal detectors but those with Capitol ID badges can skip going through the detectors.

Powell said only that there is a ""policy in place,"" and that Capitol police have been briefed, but he did not elaborate.

Private establishments where concealed guns will soon be allowed, including bars and churches, may still prohibit weapons but must give written or verbal warnings to carriers that such rules exist.

Dennis Lee, the chancellor for administrative affairs at the Catholic Diocese of Little Rock, said the new law changed nothing at the area's Roman Catholic churches: Guns are still banned.",2/1/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Feeling disrupted - Gun law unnerves in 'island of peace',"The Second Amendment guarantees every American the right to be stupid in his handling of guns. It should not require it.

Arkansas is entering a new era of its already strong gun culture. Just recently, Gov. Asa Hutchinson offered his election-year support for the interpretation of a vague state law that authorizes any person to ""open carry"" - i.e., carrying a holstered gun in full view for anyone to see. And at public college and universities across the state, 2018 will be the year Arkansans will become eligible to earn an ""enhanced"" permit that will authorize them to carry a concealed handgun on those campuses.

The open carry provision isn't exactly new. Lawmakers slipped the language affecting the change into law in 2013. In hindsight, it's clear the change was not honestly debated and had much more significant impact than many who voted for it believed they were supporting. Now, though, most of the leaders in government who matter in its interpretation lean toward the open carry interpretation.

Even with that change, it's hard to imagine a return to the Old West. We suspect there won't be many gun owners strutting around town with guns on their hips. But more will wear one, as they have for years, when they're in the deer woods or in other situations where law enforcement is probably far away.

The more disruptive change - at least gauging from the response on university campuses - is state Rep. Charlie Collins' legislation that creates an enhanced concealed carry permit. That permit and its eight hours of training beyond a traditional permit will allow a person 21 or older to possess a handgun on public college campuses.

It is a flawed law, to say the least. Naturally, some say it's faulty solely because it accomplishes what Collins sought to achieve - an end to college campuses as supposed gunfree zones. We know from experience that someone intent on harming college students and faculty isn't usually dissuaded by the existence of no-gun policies.

But today's subject is a real flaw, born amid the contentious debate over Collins' legislation, his devotion to remove barriers to its eventual passage and opponents' antipathy toward even sensible change that might be viewed as handing a victory to the NRA.

It makes no sense that a person authorized to carry a handgun on campus and who lives in campus housing has only one place to ""store"" that handgun, and that's in his own locked automobile in a public parking lot. The law does not allow for any gun to be stored in a dorm room.

Collins said that prohibition was an acknowledgement of concerns from campus officials who feared an unattended handgun might end up in the possession of an unauthorized person, leading to tragic results.

But is locking a loaded handgun inside a car more or less secure than locking one away in a gun safe inside a locked dorm room? Gun safes are designed to keep people from unauthorized access to guns. Cars are not.

Th e n u m b e r of on-campus residents who will pursue and qualify for an enhanced concealed carry permit will be small. Most on-camps residents are younger than 21, the age most must reach before being eligible for any concealed carry permit. The exceptions? People older than 18 who are serving or have served in the military can obtain a permit.

Arkansas has 3 million residents, with about 720,000 under 18. That leaves, roughly, about 2 million people older than 21. The number of traditional concealed carry permits issued in the state totals about 220,000. So somewhere between 9 and 10 percent of the general population obtained permits.

A much tinier portion attends or works on college campuses, so it's reasonable to posit that the number of people on a college campus who will go through the cost and trouble of getting the enhanced concealed carry permit will be exceptionally small.

Lockable gun safes make any environment where a gun is present safer, at least in terms of not allowing a gun into the ""wrong"" hands. Is it better for a permit holder to be required when sitting around the dorm, say, playing video games, to have his handgun on his body or secured in a gun safe?

Does it make people safer for a dorm resident to have to walk down to his car each night - when most car break-ins happen - to lock away his gun before he goes to bed? Surely no one advocates a permit holder should be sleeping with a gun in his or her bed? This law apparently does.

The debate over guns on campus was strong, and deservedly so. But lawmakers decided the days of gunfree college campuses were over. That's done.

Now, we suggest lawmakers give permit holders who live in dorms an opportunity - no, a requirement - that a handgun should be locked in a gun safe anytime it's not physically on their bodies.

State Rep. Greg Leding of Fayetteville has pointed out how ridiculous it is that a dorm resident would have to keep his gun strapped on if he had to walk down the hallway to a shower or visit to the restroom. Leding points out the situation to ridicule what he believes to be bad law allowing guns on campus.

But it's the law now. We encourage lawmakers to fine tune the situation to allow for more safety, and gun safes deliver just that.

WHAT'S THE POINT?

Arkansas has created a situation for the few concealed carry permit holders who will live in college dorms that makes people less safe. Lawmakers should

fix it.",1/22/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Campuses prepare for guns in dorms,"Students in campus housing at the state's public colleges and universities will soon be living with the prospect of sharing a residence with armed classmates. The state's expanded concealed-carry law raises new questions for school leaders and campus communities when it comes to housing.

The law prohibits license holders from storing guns in a dorm room, leaving schools to decide on protocols for handling any storage violations by students. Schools must also

decide how to deal with any requests for room changes from students uncomfortable with having a roommate carrying a handgun.

State lawmakers last year greatly expanded concealed carry for those who go through training to receive what's known in Arkansas as an enhanced license. None have yet been issued - a required exam for firearms instructors could be offered for the first time this month, an Arkansas State Police spokesman said - but enhanced license holders will be allowed to carry handguns in many public facilities that previously had been off-limits.

Public colleges and universities in recent months began publishing information online about the law and holding informational sessions to prepare for concealed carry coming to classrooms, public grounds and campus housing.

While most students in campus housing will be too young to obtain a license, some schools have a significant percentage of older students living on campus.

At Arkansas State University at Jonesboro, more than 30 percent of the school's 3,050 students in university housing this past fall were 21 or older, according to data provided by the school.

The state requires applicants for a concealed-carry license to be at least 21, with military-related exceptions.

In Jonesboro, two training sessions were held in November for Arkansas State University residential-life employees and students in leadership roles with campus housing, said Brad Phelps, general counsel with the Arkansas State University System.

""I spent the afternoon with them, and we talked through a lot of it, and I was asked some really good, informed questions,"" Phelps said.

Many questions involved various hypothetical scenarios and how to respond appropriately, Phelps said. He said he emphasized to housing staff members that ""the new law did not make them law enforcement officials.""

Should staff members see a weapon lying around a residence hall, ""the campus police or campus security are the appropriate ones to help deal with it,"" Phelps said.

If a student license holder violates the storage prohibition, ""we would treat that as a violation of the weapons policy, and it would just go through student conduct, much in the way any other violation of policy is handled through student conduct,"" Phelps said.

The university has ""initial hearing officers"" who review student conduct complaints, which can then result in a hearing and possible disciplinary action, according to online information about the school's student conduct policy.

Phelps added that the student conduct officers ""really try to take into account the facts and circumstances leading to the violation in an attempt to both understand why something happens and also ensure that the violation doesn't happen again.""

Storage is allowed in the licensee's ""own locked and unattended motor vehicle in a publicly owned and maintained parking lot,"" the university's online information states.

At the University of Central Arkansas, Christina Madsen, the school's associate vice president for communications, public relations and marketing, in a written statement noted that ""there are criminal penalties for violating the campus-carry law.""

The law allowing campus carry, Act 562, states that ""storage of a handgun in a university or college-operated student dormitory or residence hall is prohibited under"" a different section of state law.

That section of Arkansas law, 5-73-119, refers to general prohibitions on handgun possession on school property. Unless allowed by concealed-carry laws, violating the prohibition is a Class D felony.

Such felonies upon conviction carry a punishment of up to six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.

Madsen went on to say that when it comes to a student violating the concealed-carry law, disciplinary action could include dismissal from the university.

The law took effect Sept. 1 but provided time for state police to create training program rules.

For firearms instructors, ""the first test will probably be administered by the end of the month,"" state police spokesman Bill Sadler said.

Instructors would likely know the results within 48 hours, he said.

Those who pass would then be able to offer the new enhanced training, which will consist of approximately eight hours of instruction - five to six hours of classroom training plus up to two hours of firing range qualification - according to state police rules.

While it may only be a few weeks before enhanced training is offered, some school officials in response to questions from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said they were still awaiting details of the required training.

""At this point, no one wants to speculate on how policies will be written and implemented across campus until we know details of the enhanced training requirement and get guidance from UA System,"" Tracy Courage, news director for the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said in an email. UALR is one of six universities in the UA System.

Phelps said that Arkansas State University at Jonesboro has a process for handling student requests to change rooms.

""This just hasn't come up yet,"" Phelps said when asked about how the university would respond to a student seeking to change rooms upon discovering that a roommate carries a handgun.

Information about who has a permit is not considered public.

""The identity of concealed-carry licensees is confidential,"" Fredricka Sharkey, the University of Central Arkansas' media relations director, said in an email, adding that the university ""cannot guarantee"" that a student's roommate won't obtain an enhanced-carry permit.

Arkansas is one of 10 states to allow concealed weapons on some or all public campuses, according to the National Association of Student Affairs Professionals.

State Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, who introduced the bill that eventually became law, cited concerns about mass shootings as a reason to expand concealed carry to campuses. Leaders of state public universities opposed the idea, fearing more guns would lead to less safe campuses.

The Arkansas law differs from what's in place in some nearby states.

In Kansas, for example, no specific license is required for those 21 and over to carry a concealed handgun. On the University of Kansas campus, guns can be stored inside a student residence.

This past fall, 276 students 21 or older lived in campus housing at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, about 4.6 percent of all students in university-owned housing.

UA freshman Christine Prichard, 19, said in a written message that she saw no problems with the law as long as license holders are trained and certified.

She added that if students are licensed to carry a handgun, ""they should be able to keep it wherever they want as long as they're being safe.""

Peggi Farrell Stewart, in a written message, said her son Quinn is a freshman living in UA campus housing. She opposes the law.

""More guns beget more gun violence. Perhaps allowing students to carry an alternative weapon such as stun guns or pepper spray is more effective,"" said Farrell Stewart, a principal at a Houston high school.

At John Brown University, a private Christian university in Siloam Springs, Michael Lane, 21, said he would be interested in obtaining an enhanced carry license if he attended a public university.

The expanded concealed carry law does not apply to private colleges and universities, which can continue to ban concealed weapons.

""I think that it provides more security and protection for myself and others,"" Lane said. But he said he agreed that guns should not be allowed to be stored inside dorm rooms.",1/16/2018,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Campus gun rules approved by panel - Firearms in dorm rooms stir debate,"Arkansas State Police rules for an ""enhanced"" concealed-carry licensing program cleared their last legislative hurdle Friday, bringing the state one step closer to allowing gun owners to take their weapons onto public college campuses and into bars and other public buildings.

Nearly two hours of debate saw two unusual allies try to defeat the rules and spike the implementation of Arkansas' so-called campus-carry law, Act 562 of 2017, which lawmakers passed in the spring toward the end of a regular legislative session.

Democrats raised concerns during the debate that the rules were written to allow guns inside dormitory rooms, which they said violated the legislative intent of the law. Some Republicans, on the other hand, said the rules weren't needed at all under a plain reading of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But the Legislative Council, in a 24 to 12 vote with ayes cast by Republicans and some centrist Democrats, overcame the opposition and approved the rules, allowing the state to move toward issuing the enhanced-carry licenses. Those who want enhanced licenses will have to take additional training and meet marksmanship requirements to prepare them for active-shooter situations.

The extra training can begin once instructors take their additional tests required by the rules, according to a state police spokesman.

Some concealed-carry license instructors have said they don't like the enhanced-license rules, which require them to offer both the regular and additional courses.

Rep. B ob Ballinger, R-Hindsville, attempted to alleviate those concerns, promising that lawmakers would return during the fiscal session early next year to amend the law and make the courses optional for instructors.

But opposing Republicans said implementing rules could have immediate consequences if gun instructors stopped offering the training altogether.

""If you pass this today, the clock starts ticking,"" said Rep. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, who successfully moved to table consideration of the rules at a

committee meeting earlier in the week.

Had the Legislative Council failed to approve the rules, state police would not have been able to enforce them, effectively blocking the state from issuing any enhanced licenses, said Marty Garrity, the director of the Bureau of Legislative Research. The Legislative Council is a body of lawmakers that meets between legislative sessions to watch over state government actions.

Failing to approve the rules also could have opened up the state or the Legislature to a lawsuit by someone hoping to force them to implement the rules, which were required by Act 562, she told lawmakers who inquired about the consequences of voting down the rules.

House Speaker Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, summed up the opposition to the rules as ""buyer's remorse on the vote taken in the session.""

Some of the opponents had strong feelings about the way the campus-carry law was passed earlier this year.

Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, called the legislation a ""debacle,"" while Rep. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, said the continued squabbles ""prove how quickly and haphazardly [Act 562] was approved.""

Before Act 562 was passed in the spring, supporters had to pull it out of a committee where the members were at a stalemate. After giving the bill final approval, lawmakers had to make changes after officials from several collegiate athletics conferences complained about the possibility of guns being allowed at sporting events.

The chief concern voiced by Leding and other Democrats was that the rules skirted language in the law making it illegal to store a handgun in a college dormitory.

Under the state police rules, storage does not include when the gun is within arm's reach of the licensee. Mary Claire McLaurin, an attorney for the agency, said it was a ""difficult process"" to tailor the rules specifically to the law, and that the law did not prohibit carrying inside dormitories.

""A lot of people would say, 'Well, I sleep with it under my pillow, I sleep with it in my bedside table, it's readily acceptable for use,'"" McLaurin said. ""All of those things are what we consider possession.""

Sen. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, said any rule that would allow guns inside dormitories was inconsistent with the legislative intent of Act 562. She objected to approving the rules on that ground.

That prompted Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, to raise his own objection on the grounds that the rules violated the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which he said trumps whatever the state Legislature has to say about where gun owners can carry.

The Second Amendment states: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

What followed Stubblefield's objection was a quagmire of motions and questions about what the Legislative Council was actually asked to vote on. At one point, Elliott and Stubblefield tried to merge their objections into one, before deciding to move on with two separate votes about whether either senator had grounds to object to the rules being approved.

Stubblefield's motion sank on a voice vote. Faced with no other way to oppose the rules, he and several other Republicans then voted in support of Elliott's objection, which failed by a vote of 24 to 12.

With the objections voted down, the rule was approved.

After the meeting, Ballinger reiterated that he wanted use the fiscal session in February to ""clean up"" language in the gun law to allow instructors to forgo teaching the enhanced courses. He said because those instructors have six months to get certified to teach the enhanced course, none of them should be affected if they decide against doing so before the fiscal session.

Fiscal sessions are held to consider only appropriations bills. Two-thirds of each house must agree to consider a nonappropriation bill during the fiscal session. The next fiscal session starts Feb. 12 and is to last 30 calendar days unless extended by three-fourths vote by both houses.

Democrats will look to bring up their own changes to the campus-carry legislation, namely the issue of carrying in dorm rooms, during the fiscal session, said Sen. Will Bond, D-Little Rock.

Both he and Leding said they would need to do more research before deciding where they stand on the concerns Republicans raised regarding what courses instructors have to teach.",12/16/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Panel delays campus-gun training rules,"The idea of allowing trained gun owners to take concealed weapons onto college campuses and in bars and public buildings again divided state lawmakers Tuesday, months after they passed Arkansas' ""campus-carry"" law.

Proponents of the new law, which required the Arkansas State Police to come up with rules for an ""enhanced"" concealed-carry training program, argued for the Rules and Regulations Subcommittee of the Legislative Council to approve those rules Tuesday so that the state can begin licensing gun owners to carry in now-forbidden areas early next year.

Plans for a vote on the rules were tabled, however, after three guns-rights advocates reignited arguments that the law - Act 562 of 2017 - did not go far enough in extending rights.

Instead of approving the new rules, lawmakers on the subcommittee decided to hold the matter for a vote Friday before the full Legislative Council. The council is a body of lawmakers that reviews state government matters between legislative sessions.

The move essentially punted the decision. Even had the committee voted to approve the rules, the full council also would have had to OK that decision Friday.

No members of the public came to speak for or against the new concealed-carry rules themselves. During this year's regular legislative session, college administrators and police officials traveled to Little Rock to oppose the bill that became the law.

Instead, the speakers Tuesday said that they felt the new law did not give them the ability to take their guns anywhere they are currently prohibited from carrying. At one point, 60-year-old Mark Cochran of Benton read aloud the Second Amendment of the Constitution, with which he said lawmakers appeared to have little familiarity.

Each of the public speakers said they believed Arkansas is an open-carry state, meaning gun owners don't legally need a permit to carry a firearm. It is the nonbinding opinion of Attorney General Leslie Rutledge that Arkansas laws do allow open carry.

""We don't really see a benefit to it,"" Bob Bailey said of Act

562. Bailey, a concealed-carry instructor from Russellville, later handed a reporter a business card for his campaign to run in a state Senate special election next year.

""I don't see any more privileges or protections than I have now,"" said Shane Shackleford of Russellville, who, along with Bailey, is a member of the River Valley Gun Club.

Sen. Trent Garner, R-El Dorado, one of the sponsors of the campus-carry law, disputed that assertion, telling Bailey that he could carry a gun from where he sat in front of lawmakers once the rules are put in place and Bailey gets an enhanced permit.

But Bailey, 58, said he believed many of the state's concealed-carry instructors would quit training if they were forced to offer the enhanced-carry classes, as the new law requires.

Mary Claire McLaurin, an attorney for the state police, said the rules were written to require instructors to teach both regular and enhanced courses in order to reflect what lawmakers had written into Act 562.

Other lawmakers, responding to the push-back, seemed less inclined to move forward with the rules.

""Us as a Legislature dropped the ball on this,"" said Rep. Joe Jett, R-Success.

Re p. B o b B a l l i n ge r, R-Hindsville, suggested that if lawmakers approve the rules, they could use the fiscal session next year to make tweaks to the law that would not require instructors to teach both concealed-carry courses.

Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, moved to send the proposed rules to some other legislative committee for further study. However, a legislative researcher told the lawmakers that they were quickly approaching the Jan. 1 deadline to adopt the rules, as required by Act 562.",12/13/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"Changes in concealed carry permits - Capitol Review with
","LITTLE ROCK - The Arkansas State Police is working on changes to concealed carry regulations to enforce the intent of Acts 562 and 859, which the legislature approved earlier this year. Act 562 expands the number of locations where a permit holder can legally carry a concealed firearm, such as public facilities. In order to legally carry in those additional locations, the owner of the firearm must complete additional training to obtain an enhanced license.

Permit holders who maintain the traditional non-enhanced will continue to be prohibited from carrying a concealed firearm in public buildings, schools, colleges, universities, churches, bars and at parades that require a permit.

A person who obtains an enhanced permit can legally carry on public colleges and universities. However, even with an enhanced permit it will be prohibited to carry concealed firearms at collegiate sporting events such as football games. Also, it will be prohibited to carry at the State Hospital or the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Also, a student with an enhanced concealed carry may not store a firearm in his or her dormitory room.

Several areas will remain prohibited, even for holders of enhanced carry permits. Those locations include prisons, courtrooms and public schools from kindergarten through grade 12. There are allowances for school security guards to carry firearms, and private schools can allow permit holders to carry on school grounds.

Churches and bars can allow or prohibit the carrying of firearms on their premises. They can post a written notice, or verbally notify the permit holder that firearms are not permitted.

At a public hearing conducted by the State Police there were questions from instructors, who train applicants in the use of firearms and teach them on the rules that specify where the carry of concealed firearms remains prohibited.

The State Police will accept written comments until 4 p.m. on November 10. The proposed regulations that will implement Acts 562 and 859 can be found on the State Police web site at the address of its Administrative and Regulatory Division: http://asp.ark.org/publications/

The page has a list of bulleted items and the top item is: ""Notice of Proposed Rules Changes -Arkansas Concealed Handgun Licensing."" If you click on it, it opens onto the proposed regulations.

After the State Police compiles the public comments and any changes in the new rules, it will submit them to the legislature's Administrative rules and Regulations Subcommittee for consideration at its December meeting.

About 225, 000 people in Arkansas have a concealed carry permit and there are about 1, 000 instructors.

Educational Adequacy The Senate Education Committee voted to make two revisions to the adequacy report that lawmakers will use in the 2018 fiscal session as the basis for deciding how much state aid to distribute to public schools. They are to add about $2 million for special education catastrophic funding and $3 million for transportation funding.

The adequacy recommendation for Fiscal Year 2019 is to increase the per pupil foundation rate to $6, 781, making the total of state aid to schools more than $3 billion.

Under the state Constitution, the state has the duty to provide an adequate education to all children in the state, regardless of the relative prosperity of the district in which they live.",11/4/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Colleges gird for firearms on campuses - Faculty members concerned about concealed-carry law,"FAYETTEVILLE - College faculty members continue to express unease with the idea of guns being allowed on campus as an expanded concealed-carry law that officially took effect Sept. 1 comes closer to implementation.

""I'm not trying to be dramatic here, but I feel very unsafe. Very unsafe that a student in one of my classes might have a weapon, and I don't quite understand how I can do my job if I feel unsafe,"" Bill McComas, a University of Arkansas, Fayetteville education professor, said at a forum on the topic held Thursday in the university's Old Main building.

Lawmakers earlier this year approved an expansion of concealed carry to the grounds of public colleges and universities, as well as other areas, for those with an enhanced license. To be eligible for the enhanced license, applicants generally must be at least 21 years old.

But Act 562 of 2017 gave police 120 days from when the law took effect, Sept. 1, to create rules for a training program.

The release of draft licensing and training procedures earlier this month provided more insight about when licenses might be issued. The guidelines stated that firearms instructors would need, as of Jan. 1, to pass a test before offering enhanced training. No licenses will be issued until the training program is complete.

A public hearing to collect

comments on the draft rules is scheduled for Tuesday at state police headquarters in Little Rock.

Since the law was passed, schools have offered sessions to update faculty and others on campus about the law, which was approved despite statements from public university leaders against allowing guns on campus.

""I'm not happy about it,"" Mike McDaniel, a communication disorders professor at Arkansas State University, said in a phone interview. ""Nobody wants to be sitting in a class with 30 or 40 freshmen or sophomores out there, worrying what's in their boot or in their purse.""

But with the change, schools have held informational sessions about the law. McDaniel, chairman of the Jonesboro campus's Faculty Senate, said an attorney with the ASU System spoke to faculty in mid-August about ""where we were at that time"" after the law's approval. Mc-Daniel said he has another presentation on the topic scheduled for an upcoming Faculty Senate meeting.

""It's time,"" McDaniel said.

At the UA forum Thursday, Matt McCoy, an associate general counsel for the UA System, said state police are seeking feedback on the proposed training guidelines, which are available at asp.arkansas.gov/publications.

The draft procedures outline a proposed six hours of study and a ""livef ire proficiency test"" for concealed-carry holders seeking the enhanced license, among other guidelines.

""I would encourage all of you to look at that, and if you have comments or questions, to submit them,"" McCoy said.

On a college campus, ""the environment is different, the concerns are different, the circumstances are a little different,"" McCoy said. The state police are accepting written comments until Nov. 10.

The law includes some exceptions for where enhanced license-holders may not carry guns, including grievance and disciplinary hearings. Guns also may not be stored in dorms, among other exclusions including college athletic event sites with security plans approved by state police.",10/28/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Finding solace - Unnerving gun legislation awaits final set of training rules,"Concealed carry of weapons on public college campuses moved a shade closer to legality in Arkansas this week.

The state is slowly marching toward implementation of the legislation that was so ardently pushed by state Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville.

The whole idea of guns on campus is still unpopular with a lot of people, including many in law enforcement, who worry about unintended consequences.

But Collins, with strong backing from the National Rifle Association, finally got his way this year as state lawmakers approved the legislation.

The version that won approval requires an enhanced training program for concealed-carry license holders who want to carry on campus and in some other places where they could not previously carry.

The Arkansas State Police must design the training program within 120 days of the law going into effect, which happened on Sept. 1. This week's posting of the first draft of the program on the state police website kicks off its review. The proposed rule changes are online at asp.arkansas.gov/publications/.

What follows is a 30-day period in which the agency will accept public comments on the guidelines.

All of this presupposes a potential rewrite of parts of the program and at least a little more time to get it finalized.

Only then will licensed firearms instructors be able to develop and offer the eight-hour courses for enhanced-carry permit holders.

So we're still a good ways off from the day anyone can take the course and qualify for an enhanced permit.

That's good news for those of us uneasy with the prospect of guns on campus in the hands of anyone other than law enforcement.

Still, another reality is coming.

Eventually, like it or not, qualifying individuals will take the course, get the enhanced license and carry their guns to school lawfully.

Charlie Collins' argument has always been that knowing some people are packing, even if the weapons are concealed, will somehow deter would-be mass killers from attacking a given college campus.

Surely, those who bother to get the enhanced training will be better equipped to respond to what the proposed rules call ""emergent situations,"" including mass shootings, than they would be without the training.

As it stands now, applicants would get six hours of study on gun safety and firearms law and two hours of training on a gun range with three chances to pass a live-fire proficiency test. Is that enough?

If the worst happened, how would responding law enforcement officers know a good guy or girl with a gun from a bad guy with a gun? As the state police major who oversees the licensing of handguns put it, an officer won't immediately know whether someone is good or bad.

It's one of the many points that law enforcement people tried to make during hearings on the legislation. They also stressed that training for law enforcement officers never ends.

Yet, these new permit holders will presumably be ready after eight hours of additional training?

Some surely will be. Maybe they already have extensive firearms experience, including some kind of background in the serve-and-protect business.

But what about the others who might have little more than the required eight hours of training to back up their carrying a gun onto a public college campus?

How might they react in a tense, potentially tragic situation? There are no answers to such questions.

And that isn't even the most common concern of those who worry about this changing policy.

What about careless carry? That's the sort that might be practiced by someone who unintentionally discharges a weapon, leading to accidental injury or worse.

That has already happened on the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville when someone with no authority to have a gun there shot himself.

Will the presence of more guns, even lawfully concealed and carried, make such accidents more or less likely?

Then there is the possibility that someone will take a gun away from the licensed permit holder, presenting risk to those involved and to anyone nearby.

There are way too many unnerving scenarios to cite here. Yet, the truth is those of us who are concerned about them cannot stop the inevitability of having more guns on our college campuses.

About all we can take solace in is that the state police have, to the extent the law allows, tried to create an enhanced training program to mitigate the bad effects of this new law.

And they're taking their time to put it in place.",10/18/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
ASU issues guidance on new gun law,"Don't pack that sidearm just yet.

A new state law that allows enhanced carry in previously forbidden places such as bars, churches and college campuses takes effect Sept.

1. But there's a catch: The same law calls for concealed carry permit holders to have enhanced training before taking weapons onto those properties.

And that training has yet to be created.

It'll likely be 2018 before any gun-toters can carry on those grounds, college and university leaders said, because Sept. 1 starts the clock - the countdown of 120 days the Arkansas State Police has to design the enhanced training program.

""Quite frankly, it's going to take every bit of that to get it done,"" said Bill Sadler, a state police spokesman. ""There is a learning curve for the state police to get back into the mindset that this is going to change what has existed since 1992.""

Creating rules isn't as easy as it sounds: State police have to decide the do's and don'ts of the enhanced training and educate the current concealed carry license instructors before anyone can even earn the enhancement, he said.

And there are still smaller pieces, including reciprocity agreements that allow concealed carry permit holders who earned the license from another state to carry lawfully in Arkansas, and campus safety assessment plans, which can preclude concealed carry at certain locations.

The 120-day period has left public colleges and

universities in a wait-and-see mode for the finalized rules. But it hasn't stopped administrators and general counsel from preparing.

As the fall semester begins, the schools are reminding students, faculty and staff that weapons are still prohibited from dormitories or residence halls and can only be stored in locked, unattended vehicles in a public college or university parking lot.

Northwest Arkansas Community College is working on a communication plan to let people know what the law entails. That will involve social media, email messages and daily announcements, said Teresa Taylor, interim executive director of institutional policy, risk management and compliance. She leads a college task force examining which college policies and procedures need to be changed in response to Act

562.

The task force has met several times since March. Its accomplishments so far include revising the code of student conduct and completing a statement related to weapons on campus.

Faculty and staff continue to ask questions pertaining to the law. There is passion among supporters and opponents of the new law, she said.

""What we want to make sure is we are in compliance,"" Taylor said.

THE LAW

During the legislative session, leaders of colleges and universities had pushed back against what will be Act 562 of 2017. Still, Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, who sponsored the bill, forged on with his goal of making campuses safer.

Knowing that there are no gun-wielding people at colleges and universities - except for campus police - ""it almost creates the perfect environment for this type of killer,"" Collins said, referring to a ""rampage killer,"" whom he described as a mass shooter with no warning signs before a turnaround event, such as a termination. ""I believe [the new law] will deter and reduce the amount of gun violence in Arkansas.""

The new law pairs with Act 859 of 2017, which restricts carrying a concealed weapon at teaching hospitals, day cares, collegiate athletic events and private colleges, bars or churches that choose not to allow concealed handguns.

Collins said the education leaders' concerns were typically twofold: that campus police may not know how to respond in a shooting if there are ""good guys with a gun"" and that there may be accidental discharges.

""The concealed carry law works in malls and restaurants all over the state, and police forces deal with concealed carry holders all over the state,"" he said. ""Our police are well-trained and know how to handle these situations, and  Arkansas concealed carry license holders know how to behave.

""The reality is this is a very responsible group.""

Accidents ""sadly"" occur anyway, he said, and there's no guarantee that won't happen.

""In that sense, it's a matter of does benefit outweigh risk,"" Collins said. ""I believe it does.""

MAKING PREPARATIONS

The state's university systems - Arkansas State University and the University of Arkansas - gave their schools some guidance on the matter.

""We have been taking questions and comments from all of our campuses, divisions and units to make sure everyone is on the same page with implementation and other things, such as signage and exemptions,"" said Nate Hinkel, director of communications for the UA System.

The UA System - which has five universities, seven community colleges, an academic medical center, a public residential high school and other divisions and schools - is considering training sessions with campus security officers and is drafting a new systemwide weapons policy, he said.

The policy encourages its entities to create their own rules with campus-specific ""exemptions permitting the use and storage of weapons related to the scope of an individual's employment or to regular educational or recreational activities conducted under the supervision of appropriate university personnel.""

The University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, which placed information on the new law online at safety.uark.edu, is encouraging its campus community to send any additional questions to feedback@uark.edu, said Mark Rushing, assistant vice chancellor of university relations. UA, too, has conducted campus forums on the topic.

""We learned a lot from the participants in the community discussion, and it's this process of working together to understand all perspectives that's key to our campus transitioning to concealed carry,"" he said. ""One of the things we learned was that we need to convene more of these informational sessions. Message received, we're moving forward with that.""

Joe Spivey, Northwest Arkansas Community College board vice chairman, asked whether the college would offer the training necessary to obtain the permit endorsement.

Concealed-carry training providers will offer the training, and the college is not a licenses provider, Taylor said. Information on obtaining permits and a list of instructors is available on the state police website, asp.arkansas.gov.

Guns will not be allowed at Farmington High School and The Jones Center in Springdale, two buildings off-campus that the college uses.

""So when we have students moving between sites to take classes, they're going to have to be careful of that,"" Jorgenson said.

Trustee Mark Scott mentioned an issue that came up this summer at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Questions were raised there over how the presence of a charter high school on campus would affect implementation of the state law, because federal law prohibits guns within 1,000 feet of a public or private school.

The university system released a legal opinion in June stating while guns won't be allowed in the buildings where the charter school is located, they will be allowed elsewhere on campus once the new law takes effect.

Taylor said she doesn't anticipate any buildings on Northwest Arkansas Community College's main campus to be exempt from the law. She was seeking clarification, however, on how the testing center on the Student Center's third floor would be affected.

""So that's one of the questions I've posed to the [attorney general],"" she said. ""That wouldn't be a building; that would be the testing center itself.""

The Law:

Then and now

A 2013 state law allowed faculty and staff members with concealed-carry permits to bring their weapons on campuses of public colleges and universities, unless the boards of those institutions voted annually to opt out of the law. Every institution opted out each year.

Act 562 of 2017 eliminated that option, but required anyone who carries a gun on college campuses to obtain eight hours of training beyond what is necessary to receive a concealed-carry permit.

"Guns stay home, for now - Concealed carry coming to campuses, but not yet
","Concealed carry weapons are coming to Arkansas' college campuses, but their lawful carry will be delayed somewhat.

University of Arkansas Chancellor Joseph Steinmetz recently reminded the campus community in Fayetteville that a pair of new state laws (Acts 562 and 859) go into effect on Sept. 1.

The laws can't be fully implemented, however, until the Arkansas State Police creates the necessary training for an ""enhanced"" certification to carry a concealed weapon. And, the first candidates must secure those permits before they may lawfully take a gun to campus.

The certification requirement is part of the controversial legislation successfully championed by state Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, in the last regular legislative session.

He had been trying for years to get the Legislature to authorize concealed carry on campus (as it has in other public places). With strong backing from the National Rifle Association, he got the law passed on his latest attempt.

The requirement for up to eight hours of enhanced training came with it.

The Arkansas State Police must develop the training program that is intended to equip qualifying enhanced permit-holders to deal with an active-shooter scenario.

The State Police have 120 days after the effective date of the law to design the program. Bill Sadler, spokesman for the agency, expects State Police will take every one of those 120 days to sign off on a certification program.

And, he said, the whole process could take longer, since the newly promulgated rules may require legislative review, too.

Plus, the people the State Police authorize to do the training for concealed carry must be trained themselves on the enhanced certification. Then and only then can any candidate take the training and get certified to carry a weapon on campus.

There's another challenge, too.

Remember how the law was amended to keep sports fans from carrying weapons into a stadium or other arena?

Concealed carry at sporting events may only be prohibited if the institution has an approved security plan in place for the venue.

The process and requirements are still being worked out for such plans. And the planning gets complicated when they're trying to secure, say, a golf course or a cross-country race route, not just a closed-in stadium or arena.

So there's good reason for expecting a delay in implementation of the new laws.

That delay is also the source of considerable relief for those who never really wanted to see more guns on college campuses - unless they're in the hands of trained police officers.

But thanks to Charlie Collins and other supporters, the delay is only temporary.

Eventually, the security plans will be made and approved. The enhanced certification process will be cleared and the training made available. And there will be plenty of people who seek the permits, including many who truly believe as Collins does that they'll be making the campuses safer for all.

Others still worry about the mere presence of guns and the potential for their misuse, unintended or otherwise.

While the debate about guns on campus won't ever be over, Arkansas law will allow them to be there.

The University of Arkansas, like the other campuses in the state, is wisely preparing for the change.

Chancellor Steinmetz' email to students last week explained the coming changes and promised notice to the campus when the permit process actually is complete and full implementation begins.

In the meantime, the university is offering an online resource to answer questions and further explain the new concealed carry laws.

Check out www.safety.uark.edu for information, including frequently asked questions from the perspective of students, faculty, staff, parents and visitors to the campus.

The site details the law and makes it clear, among other things, that ""concealed"" means concealed.

Anyone with the necessary permit must keep a weapon, even a holstered gun, concealed except in a life-threatening situation. Weapons must be somewhere completely out of sight.

The university suggests someone who sees a weapon being displayed should report it to campus police. If it is being displayed in a threatening manner, the call should go to 911.

""Carry"" also means carry at the university. The only place on campus a weapon may be stored is in a locked and unattended motor vehicle on university or public property. Nowhere else. Not in a locker, a filing cabinet, a locked car.

One other point jumps out from the university guidelines. The law will be strictly enforced.

Not only are those who violate the new state laws subject to legal action under the laws themselves, university employees who violate them may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Students, too, could face disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the university.

Of course, no one needs worry for a while yet. Implementation of the new state laws is months away.",8/16/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette

""We see this as an opportunity for us,"" Hall said after Monday's meeting. ""If we perform, we'll be funded at a level that's comparable to other institutions across the state. So for us, it's a matter of fairness.""

The college this fiscal year got about 29 percent of its revenue - about $11.7 million - from the state. About 50 percent came from tuition and fees and another 15 percent from a millage tax.

Northwest Arkansas Community College officials long have pointed out they receive far less state money per fulltime student than other twoyear schools in the state, meaning the college must make up for that deficit in other ways.

The Department of Higher Education last month approved a scoring system that will provide a school's ""productivity index."" Department staff will use that index to determine whether a school improved from one year to the next. That would determine whether the school gets more, less or the same funding from the state for fiscal year 2019.

The coordinating board will make a recommendation in October on the college's funding for fiscal 2019, Hall said.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson has pledged $10 million toward higher education funding for fiscal 2019, which begins July 1, 2018.

Hall mentioned numerous other new laws of importance to the college Monday.

Senate Bill 673, which became Act 1118, states any high school student who qualifies for a free or reduced-price meal shall not be required to pay any of the costs for up to six credit hours of college courses taken concurrently.

Either the college or the school district - or a combination of both - will be required to pay for those credit hours.

The law takes effect this fall, but some clarification is needed on it, said Evelyn Jorgenson, college president.

""It says a maximum of six credit hours,"" Jorgenson said. ""We don't know if that means six credit hours a semester, or a year  or for a lifetime.""

Northwest Arkansas Community College officials met with about a dozen school district superintendents from the area last month to discuss this subject. The college provides a 60 percent tuition discount to high school students, Hall said.

A lot of higher education officials would like to see a concurrent tuition rate that could be applied to institutions statewide, Hall said.

Hall also discussed House Bill 1839, sponsored by state Rep. Rick Beck, R-Center Ridge, known as the ""Local Food, Farms and Jobs Act.""

Any agency that receives $25,000 from the state for the purchase of food must ensure at least 10 percent of its budget for food is spent on local food or farm products for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That figure jumps to 20 percent for the following fiscal year.

Hall said the college's culinary department, Brightwater: A Center for the Study of Food, buys a lot of food. The college will far exceed the percentages laid out in the law, he said.

""We'll probably be a model for that legislation, actually,"" Hall said.

Act 562, signed into law in March, allows anyone with a concealed-carry permit to bring a gun on campus if they get up to eight hours of training beyond what's otherwise necessary to obtain a permit.

The law goes into effect Sept. 1. The Arkansas State Police has 120 days to write the curriculum for the extra training.

""So it will be next spring before anybody is legally able to carry on campus,"" Hall said.

In the meantime, the college has assembled a committee that's examining the implications of the gun law and how it meshes with all kinds of college policies.

Promotional and recruitment

The Northwest Arkansas Community College Board of Trustees approved spending $40,000 on ""promotional and recruitment"" items for the fiscal year that starts July 1. The items were part of the overall budget of $41.9 million the board approved last month, but state statute requires the board approve of the expenditure specifically. Student Activities is the department receiving the largest portion of the promotional and recruitment money at $8,000.",6/13/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
Clarks bill allows guns in employer parking lots,"FAYETTEVILLE - The University of Arkansas, Fayetteville is seeking metal detectors and advice on setting up the equipment to maximize ""both security and speed of entry"" at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium.

When asked if metal detectors will be in use this fall, university spokesman Kevin Trainor said Monday that off icials continue working on a security plan.

The university's request for proposals comes after state lawmakers last month expanded concealed carry of guns at public colleges and universities. Legislators later added an exemption for collegiate athletic event sites.

To qualify for exemption, sites must submit an annual security plan that meets approval from the state police.

""UAPD and Razorback Athletics are working jointly to prepare security plans to be submitted to the Arkansas State Police, as outlined in the law, for the upcoming athletics seasons,"" Trainor said in an email, adding that fans will be informed before the 2017 football season about any new security procedures.

Trainor said the university's request for bids is ""not directly related to concealed carry in Arkansas.""

Instead, he said, UA began drafting the proposal ""as part of ongoing security planning for major security events that may require heightened security,"" with the university looking to follow guidelines from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The university has no metal-detector equipment for use at athletic event sites, and UA's bid request, dated Friday, ""is designed to estimate some of the potential costs associated with implementation of metal detectors,"" Trainor said.

In 2014, The Associated Press reported that Boise State University in Idaho paid $191,000 for 50 metal detectors and 75 hand wands used at the school's football stadium. Duke University in North Carolina and Pennsylvania State University are among a few schools that use metal detectors or wands at their football stadiums.

UA seeks help to ""analyze UAF's current football stadium"" and determine the amount and features needed for the equipment.

The goal is ""to enhance security measures during events hosted on campus maximizing both security and speed of entry,"" according to the bid document.

UA makes clear that its request is not solely focused on Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, as it seeks rent-to-own or purchase proposals for hand-held and walk-through metal detectors ""to handle all threat levels to be used during indoor and outdoor athletic events,"" the document states.

The expanded con - cealed-carry law, Act 562, passed despite opposition from higher-education leaders in the state. The law allows concealed-carry permit holders who complete extra training to carry on campus and into bars and churches and many publicly-funded buildings.

Exemptions added later create three ""firearm-sensitive"" areas: the Arkansas State Hospital, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and collegiate athletic events.

Despite National Rifle Association opposition, lawmakers approved the exemptions, with some crediting a statement by Southeastern Conference Commissioner Greg Sankey opposing guns at sporting events as a factor in the vote for what is now Act 859. UA's athletic programs compete in the SEC.

Both laws take effect Sept. 1, but the additional training for the expanded concealed-carry law has yet to be developed by state police, who have up to 120 days from the law's effective date to set up the training.

Act 859 states that security measures ""shall include"" having security personnel on site, barricades, ""use of a magnetometer or other metal-detecting device designed to detect a weapon,"" or ""other measures or devices designed to protect the public from a security threat.""

Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, who introduced the bill that became Act 859, said lawmakers in both legislative chambers wanted specifics about what to expect in these security plans.

""Having metal detectors as part of that plan was important, so it was included in the language,"" Dismang said, adding that the law leaves open details like where they might be set up or whether wands, as opposed to walk-in units, might be appropriate.

""The thought was that if you're asking people to unarm themselves to attend an event, then they needed to be provided assurance that they're in a safe place,"" Dismang said.

As far as cost, ""I think there's an economical way to do it,"" Dismang said. He also said cost might be a factor in what's presented to state police.

Trainor said the university has not been told what safety features must be included in plans to meet approval.

Bill Sadler, a public information officer for the state police, in response to a question about how the agency would review a security plan lacking metal detectors, said in an email that ""rules have not been crafted and research continues.""",4/18/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
It's not complicated - College doesn't need to imagine all gun scenarios,"It should come as no surprise Northwest Arkansas Community College trustees did last week as they've done for four years by voting to ban people with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns onto campus.

State Rep. Charlie Collins' new law allowing concealed handguns for specially trained permit holders on campus won't take effect until Sept. 1, so the trustees are simply maintaining the status quo. Many campus leaders across the state want nothing but the status quo, but the Legislature thought differently.

Come Sept. 1 any concealed carry permit holder can take new training to earn an enhanced permit. That permit will allow him to carry a handgun in several places where concealed handguns were formerly banned. People with a non-enhanced permit won't be legally authorized to carry their weapons in these newly authorized locations.

The community college has taken the change seriously, appointing a task force to review the circumstances in which the college might need to adopt new policies and procedures. They're wise to think through the implications of the new legislation. But it also appears as though they're working themselves into a lather by presuming the college needs to make a ton of adjustments to prepare for concealed carry.

At last week's meeting, college President Evelyn Jorgenson gave an example. ""For example, what happens if we are taking students on a field trip and the place we're going to does not allow guns, yet they're allowed to carry guns here,"" Jorgenson said.

The answer is pretty simple: Nothing.

It's the permit holder's responsibility - and always has been - to be sure he complies with all the limitations under the law. That's something people willing to get a permit are generally prepared to do. They tend to make every effort to stay within the law.

Act 562 spells out any permit holder carrying a gun onto a campus is making a ""personal choice"" and is ""not immune from personal liability with respect to possession or use of a concealed handgun."" The act also declares a college is immune from liability for monetary damages related to a permitted employee's use or failure to use a concealed handgun.

Preparedness is admirable, but it will not be the community college's job to manage concealed carry permit holders and ensure they're living up to their responsibilities.

A couple of weeks back I attended a session at the community college where faculty, staff and students discussed their concerns. One instructor wanted to ask students to voluntarily confide in her about their plans to carry. It would allow her, she said, to know the circumstances as leader of her classroom should a crisis break out.

But that's all for naught, because permit holders can carry one day and not the next. If a crisis does break out, it's entirely the permit holder's decision whether to take the serious step of pulling his weapon out. And he is not obligated in the least to act as a law enforcement officer might, nor should he.

Concealed carry is about personal defense for the permit holder and, in certain circumstances, those around him or her. No college should expect otherwise nor should it try to imagine every scenario in which it feels a need to mother those who choose to carry on campus.

The very nature of concealed carry is that people should never know an individual's personal weapon is present. So the college really has one responsibility under the law: Observe it.",4/17/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette

State Capitol briefs,"Some sports venues now free of gun law 

Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Monday afternoon signed into law a bill aimed at barring concealed-carry permit holders from Razorback Stadium and other locations hosting collegiate sporting events.

Senate Bill 724 by Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, also is designed to prohibit these ""enhanced"" permit holders, who will have extra training, from carrying weapons into the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the State Hospital. The bill also allows private entities not to allow these permit holders onto their property, without posting notices.

The new law will amend Act 562, signed by the governor March 22. Act 562 created the ""enhanced"" concealed-carry license that would allow the permit holders with up to eight hours of extra training to carry their weapons onto the campuses of public two- and four-year colleges and into many publicly funded buildings, including the state Capitol.

Act 562 and the law signed Monday will become effective Sept. 1. The Arkansas State Police will formulate rules to design a firearm-training program within 120 days of that effective date. More than 220,000 Arkansans have concealed-carry permits.

Senate rejects bill to require pay stubs

The Senate voted 7-17 to defeat House Bill 1625 by Rep. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, to require an employer of five or more employees to provide a pay stub at least once a month to each full-time employee who has worked at least 60 days for the employer.

The bill fell 11 votes short of the 18 required for approval. Last week, the bill fell two votes short of the 18 required for approval.

Sen. Will Bond, D-Little Rock, said the bill would be good for both employers and employees.

But Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, urged senators to defeat the bill, saying it's another mandate to discourage business people from running a business.

Just a bill - Lawmakers find few places they're unwilling to go,"With the 2017 session of the General Assembly nearly complete, it's time to breathe a sigh of relief. That means Arkansans didn't reach the point of watching their lawmakers debate a bill to prevent transgender holders of concealed-carry permits who are covered by the Medicare expansion from toting their firearms into the wrong bathrooms of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium.

Don't worry. I'm sure the folks at the American Legislative Exchange Council have already started their research into model legislation to do just that.

Hmm, can that be added to the state Capitol monument as the 11th commandment? Stay tuned.

We did see just about every other kind of bill, including a series of attacks on the public's rightful expectation for open government as protected by the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. The act came under attack so many times this session by Republican lawmakers the official state emblem could be a paper shredder. Based on some of the proposed changes, the state's motto could easily have been changed from Regnant Populus (The people rule) to Regnant Redacto. The only reason it wasn't is because it sounded too much like a spell from Harry Potter. Can't have that kind of demonic activity going on in the Natural State. Get thee behind me, Professor Snape.

It's unfortunate the University of Arkansas pressed for legal cover to shield more information from the public. Leaders there want Arkansans to believe the college is about imparting knowledge, but it appears they're pretty darned interested in being Hogs about it. The Buffalo River isn't the only place in danger of being polluted by a confining operation.

State lawmakers and Gov. Asa Hutchinson did manage to give us voter identification, a new mandate to show a photo identification card at our polling places before we get an opportunity to cast our ballots. If the session had gone on much longer, I wouldn't have been surprised to see a bill exempting each county's list of polling places from public release. After all, how can ""they"" vote if they don't know where the polling places are?

Another for the ALEC to-do list.

Thanks to the voters of our state, medical marijuana is coming to a dispensary near you. Despite the measure's passage by a vote of the people, some lawmakers were high on the idea of putting up barriers to the spread of pot. Clint Penzo, a freshman Republican state representative from Springdale, was able to convince his colleagues that dispensaries must retain a ""pharmacist consultant"" and sell equipment for ""vaping"" marijuana instead of smoking it but be barred from selling pipes, water pipers, bongs, chillums, rolling papers, roach clips and potato chips.

OK, that last item might have just been a typo on the copy of the bill I got.

Hutchinson got several of his measures to streamline state government passed, including the one that transfers the commission overseeing War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock to the Department of Parks and Tourism. There's no truth to rumors the state will move the stadium to Devil's Den State Park. It would never fit through the Bobby Hopper Tunnel.

Lawmakers, as noted earlier, previously approved a monument to the Ten Commandments on the state Capitol grounds. Apparently, a lot of legislators are fans of Charlton Heston, who now goes by the name Charlie Collins, who spake with authority on methods to deter those crazies who might attack a college campus. He filed a bill to let professors on college campuses carry handguns but by the time the measure became law, it had been plied with amendments until it became a Golden Gun around which the people celebrated. Heston, er, Collins may not have delivered his people to the Second Amendment Promised Land, but he got about as close as anyone could without a column of firepower leading the way.

Lastly, Arkansas apparently avoided North Carolina's tumult over the so-called ""bathroom bill,"" which was an attempt to make sure transgender people are barred from using a public restroom in conflict with the gender identified on their birth certificates. Sen. Linda Collins-Smith, a Republican from Pocahontas (pronounced pokeyur-nose-in-it), wasn't able to get her potty parameter measure out of committee. She formally withdrew it and it will go to interim study.

So, between this session and the one two years from now, if you spot someone in a public restroom who seems a little too attentive to the other users of the facility, don't freak out. He's from the government, and he's there to help.",4/3/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"Arkansas House advances concealed handgun exemption bill
","FAYETTEVILLE - By a vote of 71-20 with one abstention, the Arkansas House of Representatives Thursday in Little Rock approved Bill 724 exempting sporting events on Arkansas college campuses and also the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences from the recently passed state law allowing firearms concealed carry on Arkansas college campuses by in 2018 for those with a certificate proving they have taken an eight-hours firearms course to be approved by the Arkansas State Police.

Until amended by the bill first passed by the Senate and now the House, though it will return for Senate approval because of some slight changes, concealed carried firearms would have been allowed starting in 2018 at collegiate athletic events in Arkansas.

University of Arkansas Chancellor Joseph Steinmetz and Razorbacks Athletic Director Jeff Long both expressed gratitude the House voted to keep weapons out of Razorbacks athletic venues.

We have always been concerned about guns on campus, Steinmetz said in a statement issued through the UA Relations Department. That is why all along that we have wanted to keep the law as it was, leaving this important decision to our board of Trustees. While we have consistently asked to keep all of our campus facilities exempt, we are glad to have the carve outs for our child care and athletic facilities provided through SB724 and are thankful for all the legislators who voted in favor of this important bill.

The UA also issued a statement by Long.

We are encouraged by the action taken today by the Arkansas House of Representatives in passing SB724, Long said. The exclusions adopted in the bill, including for intercollegiate athletics venues, would address concerns outlined by Chancellor Joseph Steinmetz, Southeastern Conference Commissioner Greg Sankey and many others within and outside the Arkansas General Assembly. We are grateful to members of the Arkansas legislature for thoughtfully considering this important issue.

Greg Sankey, commissioner of the Southeastern Conference of which the University of Arkansas is a member, had urged passing Bill 724 and warned if not exempted from the HB 1249 law that given the intense atmosphere surrounding athletic events, adding weapons increases safety concerns and could negatively impact the intercollegiate athletics program at the University of Arkansas in several ways, including scheduling, officiating, recruiting and attendance.

Karl Benson, commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference, which includes Arkansas State University and the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, also supported Bill 724 exempting ASU and UALR allowing firearms at games.

During the last week I have followed closely the news articles regarding Arkansas House Bill 1249, and now also a potential amendment to what is now Act 562,"" Benson said in a statement.

Given that both the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and Arkansas State University are members of the Sun Belt Conference - and as my colleague Greg Sankey of the Southeastern Conference has stated - I too support the Arkansas State Senate's exemption in the Senate Bill 724 that would prevent firearms from being allowed inside publicly funded stadiums and arenas in the State of Arkansas.

All of Arkansas public colleges and universities previously opted out of an option to allow conceal carry of firearms by faculty before the passage of HB 1249 mandated that in 2018 those with proof of the approved course permit could carry concealed weapons on campus.",3/31/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"New Law to Allow Concealed Handguns at Public Colleges, Government Buildings","BENTONVILLE - New legislation allowing people to carry guns on college campuses raises numerous policy-related issues at Northwest Arkansas Community College that ""will be ironed out over the course of several years,"" one official said.

Ethan Beckcom, director of institutional policy, risk management and compliance, told fellow employees Tuesday the college is forming a task force to figure out how best to align its policies and procedures with the law.

Beckcom delivered the news during a meeting held to explain the law and its potential impact. It was the second of two such meetings the college this week.

""We want to walk out of here knowing pretty comfortably what the specific language says,"" Beckcom told the audience of about 50, including four college board members.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson last week signed into law House Bill 1249 allowing concealed-carry permit holders to bring guns on campus if they get up to eight hours of training beyond what is otherwise necessary to obtain a permit.

The law, also known as Act 562, takes effect Sept. 1. The task force will take time studying the matter and will recommend practices ""that ensure we're still very comfortable, this is still an environment that is very welcoming, and we can still have good dialogue in the classroom,"" Beckcom said.

The new law states those who are lawfully carrying guns on campus aren't required to notify anyone at the college. Diana Nagel, a faculty member, asked about that, saying in case danger presents itself on campus, it would help her to know in advance which of her students are carrying weapons.

Nagel said she'd like to ask her students to volunteer to share the information with her. Beckcom said that's an issue the task force needs to address and devise guidance on.

""Because ultimately, how you choose to proceed as it relates to that in your classroom may be vastly different in other classrooms,"" Beckcom said. ""We need to ensure we're doing every thing we can to balance safety on campus with individual rights and all things in between.""

Kate Burkes, director of distance learning, asked if a faculty member somehow revealed they were carrying a weapon and a student felt uncomfortable with that, would the student be obligated to continue attending the class?

That's something else the task force will have to address, Beckcom said. Several questions come into play in that scenario, including whether the burden falls on the college or the student to find a replacement course, he said.

The task force hasn't met yet. It has about 15 members representing different departments on campus, Beckcom said.

Beckcom took time to point out various emergency notification systems the college makes available to employees and students. He also noted the college's police force, members of which have accumulated more than 10,000 combined hours of training, he said.

""I hope you never find yourself in a situation where you have to call them, but if you do, I hope you don't hesitate to do that,"" he said.

Tim McGinn, Faculty Senate president, was among those attending Tuesday's meeting. McGinn said he doesn't sense faculty members are united in their opinions of allowing people to carry guns on campus.

""There are a lot of passions running high on both sides. People very happy they have the right now that the governor signed the law, and people [are] very unhappy that's the case,"" McGinn said.

McGinn added several faculty members surprised him when they informed him they are concealed-carry permit holders.

""They went through (the training) with their spouses. They were interested to know what was being taught, but also to be able to do it if they had to,"" he said. ""So I think it's a mistake to characterize anyone as a gun-toting thug who wants to have a gun on campus.""

McGinn said he wasn't aware of any faculty members at the college who were considering leaving because of the new law.

Act 562 applies to all space owned and leased by a public college or university; the only exception is facilities owned by school districts.

Beckcom said he had no way of knowing how many staff members or students might end up carrying guns on campus.

State Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, sponsored House Bill 1249. Collins has been a longtime advocate of such legislation in order to deter acts of severe violence on college campuses.

Collins in 2013 convinced fellow legislators to pass a law removing a blanket prohibition against carrying guns on campus, while allowing individual universities to adopt no-guns policies on an annual basis. Every institution since then chose to ban guns.

The last time the Northwest Arkansas Community College board voted on the matter was in April. The vote was 5-3 in favor of the administration's recommendation to maintain the gun ban.",3/29/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"Finally,sanity","""We'd make a joke that state Rep. Charlie Collins should amend his gun legislation to make all of Arkansas-from border to border-a mandatory gun-carrying zone. But we don't want to give him ideas.""

-Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, last week

We should learn to keep some things in our head. They oftentimes sound better in there.

First there was a bill to force colleges to allow some professors, administrators or employees to carry concealed weapons, if those employees/professors were trained and willing. (The previous law only allowed colleges to decide for themselves, campus to campus. And they all opted out.)

Then said bill was amended, and amended, and amended, and the lawmakers who like and maybe need the NRA's A-plus rating got offended that anybody questioned their bonafides, and amended the dang thing again till everybody with a concealed permit could carry pert near anywhere. Including not just college campuses, but the state Capitol and sporting events, but we repeat ourselves.

That'll teach 'em! (Who ""'em"" is is anybody's guess.)

But late last week, the adults were heard from. Finally. The state Senate passed a bill by President Pro Tempore Jonathan Dismang to exempt from the latest law places like the State Hospital, UAMS and collegiate athletic events. Because emotions can run high at hospitals, and folks in these latitudes take sports too seriously. That, and the NCAA might have had something to say about folks packin' at its sanctioned events.

There will be those lawmakers who oppose this bill in the House simply because the NRA tells them to. Here's a question for them: If some fool starts trouble at the next football game, can he be safely left to the dozens of police and security guards already there, or would you rather have 70 people in his section pull a gun-and have the cops, and everybody else, try to figure out who's bad and who's got a permit?

Come, let us reason together. That's always the best policy.",3/27/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
"Senate OKs concealed-carry limits - Bans proposed for State Hospital, UAMS, collegiate sports
","The ink is barely dry on a new law that will allow some concealed-carry permit holders to take their guns into many public places, and yet a bill that shot through the Senate on Thursday proposes to exempt some locations.

Under Senate Bill 724, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the State Hospital and locations hosting collegiate athletic events would be exempt from the new law.

The Senate voted 22-8 to approve SB724 by Senate President Pro Tempore Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, on Thursday afternoon. Senators had already approved the bill earlier in the day, by a vote of 22-10, but then amended it and approved it a second time.

The bill now goes to the House.

On Wednesday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed into law House Bill 1249 by Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, that will allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry firearms on college campuses and in many other public buildings, including the state Capitol. But to do so, permit holders must receive up to eight hours of what Hutchinson called ""enhanced training.""

HB1249 is now Act 562 and will become effective Sept. 1. The new law will require the Arkansas State Police to develop rules to design a firearm training program within 120 days of that effective date. More than 220,000 Arkansans have concealed-carry permits, and state police Director Bill Bryant said he's not sure how many of them will seek the extra training.

Hutchinson said Thursday that ""the unique environment of a teaching hospital makes it reasonable to exempt UAMS, and the other exception for college sporting events addresses the concerns expressed by many Arkansans.

""Because these appear to be reasonable exceptions, I will support these amendments,"" the Republican governor said in a written statement.

But the National Rifle Association ""adamantly opposes Senate Bill 724,"" NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide said.

""People have a constitutional right to self-defense wherever they are legally allowed to be,"" he said in a written statement.

Collins said Thursday afternoon that he wants to take a look at the language of SB724 and Act 562, and he wants to review other issues, such as whether the concealed-weapon permit holders with extra training would be banned from publicly owned day cares, nursing schools and ""carrying while intoxicated.""

He said he wants to get more information about SB724's ban on concealed weapons at intercollegiate athletic events.

""I appreciate what they are trying to do,"" Collins said. ""But we have to think about this together and it requires us to be surefooted.""

SB724 would exempt the weapons allowed under Act 562 from a place owned by, operated by, administered by or associated in a clinical setting with a public teaching hospital; a place that is hosting or being used for a collegiate athletic event; or the premises of the State Hospital in Little Rock.

A public teaching hospital includes the premises and buildings of UAMS under the legislation.

Dismang said in an interview that Act 562 ""has the potential to impact recruiting"" at UAMS ""and obviously would have an impact with a physician/patient relationship.

""When I read the bill, I recognized that for the most part hospitals are exempted, but there was no exemption for UAMS,"" he said. The State Hospital is located near UAMS, he said.

UAMS supports SB724 because ""there is a concern about concealed weapons being allowed in an environment of high stress, high traffic and high emotions in the various departments all of which are uninterruptedly connected to one another including internal access to the Federal Veterans Administration Hospital,"" said UAMS spokesman Pam Collar in a statement.

The bill would define a collegiate athletic event as ""a sporting or athletic contest, event or practice of an individual or a team of individuals in which one or more individuals or a team of individuals sponsored by, funded by, represented by and associated with a public or private university, college or community college competes against itself or another individual or team of individuals sponsored by, funded by, represented by or associated with a public or private university, college or community college.""

Senate Republican leader Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs said that he proposed the amendment that would exempt sites of intercollegiate athletics because ""anytime you pass a bill as comprehensive as [HB] 1249 was, there is going to be things that you didn't think"" about.

""We gotta realize we completely rewrote that bill here in about two days in really intensive negotiations between NRA, and ourselves and the bill's sponsors,"" he said.

""The day after I had an agreement, I had four people come up to me and say can we change this, can we change this, can we change that,"" Hendren said. ""I said, 'We can't now. But we may look at subsequent legislation to fix some of those things. So that's what you see happening.""

Dismang said, ""Multiple members have concerns about the sporting events and what that would do in regards to NCAA, SEC [Southeastern Conference], fundraising and a number of different issues, even outside of just safety alone.

Asked if the concern was that Arkansas' universities wouldn't been able to host events, ""there is nothing in stone that says that would be a result, but I think that is a concern that's shared,"" he said.

SB724 also would ax the requirement for particular notices to be posted by a private university or private college that adopts a policy expressly disallowing the carrying of a concealed handgun in the buildings and grounds of the school.

""It would allow them to dictate their own posting guidelines for the campus. No. 1, they have the right to opt in or opt out,"" he said.

Sen. Trent Garner, R-El Dorado, said in an interview that he strongly disagrees with SB724 because the legislation would limit the ability of people to carry concealed weapons in certain places even if they had up to eight hours of training under Act 562.

During the Senate's debate on the initial version of SB724 before it was amended, Garner said, ""It will kill the campus-carry bill we just passed"" based on its wording.

""I think we gave them the perfect loophole for every college and every community college to get out,"" he said. ""I know that Sen. Dismang did not mean to do it.""

There have been ""over a dozen killings"" at athletic events during the past 10 years, he said.

In response, Dismang said that he intended his bill to exempt UAMS and not other public colleges and universities from Act 562, and, if any amendment is needed for the bill, he would fix it.

""I'm not going to grandstand on the bill,"" he told senators.",3/24/2017,Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
