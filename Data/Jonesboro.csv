Not the guns,"I would like to begin by stating that I am a gun enthusiast. I have owned and used guns most of my life. My politics tend to be left leaning and liberal, but I am definately not a gun control fanatic. In fact, I hold a concealed-carry license and routinely carry a pistol. Having said that, I still have no problem with requiring a license to own or bear arms. We require a license to drive a car or even to catch a fish, why not to own or carry a deadly weapon?

I grew up mostly in the 1950s, turning 13 in 1959, so my pre-teen years were almost exclusively in the '50s. It has become almost cliche to say that it was a different world then. Times have indeed changed!

The foregoing has been by way of background. As a kid I can remember walking into the neighborhood mom-and-pop grocery store (there used to be one in every neighborhood) and pay a nickel (when I could lay my hands on one) for a package of firecrackers. Any time of year, not just 4th of July or New Years. It's possible that they were supposed to ask for proof of age, but no one ever did. For 50 cents I could buy a box of 50 .22 shells in the same store — also without proving my age.

I was an avid fan of outdoors magazines in those days. Every one of them that I remember reading would have at least one advertisement for what we would today call a ""Saturday Night Special."" Typical price for one of those guns was $4.95, and they could be ordered by mail. It was necessary to state that you were older than 21, but no proof was required.

I bought my first pistol at the age of 17 from a friend who was 22. He had purchased it legally at a local hardware store for the grand sum of $20! And this was no junk gun; it was an Iver Johnson eight shot .22 revolver. After keeping it a few months he got to needing money, and I gave him what he paid for it. I suppose that he technically broke the law, but such things were not uncommon then (or now for that matter)!

The foregoing has all been to set the stage for an observation that I have made but have not heard anyone else address in this whole gun control debate. In the 1950s, '60s and, to a lesser extent, the '70s guns were easily acquired by almost anyone, yet there were virtually no mass shootings! I suppose it is possible that I was just unaware, but come on, even the most clueless would have noticed two or three mass shootings every blessed month!

So, guns were easier to get but school children simply were not routinely murdering one another! People, it isn't the guns! There has to have been a fundamental cultural shift. I certainly had my difficulties at school, but it would never have even occurred to me that one option might be to bring a gun to class and waste everybody!

I don't have any final answers, I just wondered if anyone else had noticed this.",6/21/2018,Jonesboro Sun
Bills filed to expand concealed carry law,"JONESBORO — Firearms instructor Scott Vaughn is already teaching the course people with concealed carry licenses need for an enhanced license that would allow for the carrying of a gun on a college campus.

He said some now have that license in hand.

""As an instructor and a Second Amendment rights person, I think it is fine,"" he said of the enhanced license. ""I think it is good. I think the more places we can carry, the less target-enriched areas we will have for bad people.""

Still, Vaughn, who operates Vaughn's Firearms Training in Brookland, said he is in favor of a proposed amendment to not require concealed carry instructors to offer both regular and enhanced license training under the expanded concealed handgun law approved last year.

By making it a requirement, Vaughn said it puts some instructors in situations where they must offer the enhanced training even if they do not feel comfortable doing so.

The proposed amendment was filed Monday by Rep. Bob Ballinger, R-Berryville, and Sen. Trent Garner, R-El Dorado. With Arkansans now able to lawfully carry guns on a college campus, the amendment was one of two filed to tweak the state law that made it possible.

A second amendment from State Sen. Will Bond, D-Little Rock, and State Rep. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, would make it illegal to carry or possess a concealed gun in a college- or university-operated student dorm or residence hall.

Two-thirds of the House and Senate must approve taking up the measures during the fiscal session since the resolutions are not budget-related.

Act 562 allows concealed carry permit holders to take up to eight hours of enhanced training to carry concealed guns at public sites like college campuses and state buildings.

There are exemptions, such as pre-K and K-12 schools, courtrooms and prisons as well as collegiate athletic events, certain grievance and disciplinary meetings, daycares and federal buildings.

When the campus carry legislation was under consideration, spokesman Jeff Hankins said the Arkansas State University System was not in favor of allowing concealed guns in residence halls.

""We believe this amendment would be a reasonable adjustment to the current law,"" he said.

ASU senior Janai Reynolds, an interdisciplinary studies major from Little Rock, agreed. She said guns should not be on a college campus in the first place because it could lead to a negative outcome if a student loses his or her temper during an argument. She prefers to see more training offered.

However, Conrad Ray, a sophomore finance major from Memphis, said those who receive the enhanced training do so after undergoing training by Arkansas State Police so they have the knowledge and training to act responsibly.

Ray does not see how banning guns from student housing will help because it will not stop individuals who are determined to do so. Measures must be taken to enforce it, he said.

The new law took effect Sept. 1, 2017, although it wasn't until December that state lawmakers approved a series of regulations submitted by ASP to govern how the enhanced training is offered.

ASP began testing enhanced instructors two weeks ago. ASP spokeswoman Elizabeth Chapman said 73 instructors passed the test and are now verified to teach the enhanced license class. Additional testing is scheduled throughout the state in the upcoming months to give other instructors time to get trained.

""But the ASP as an agency is not required to keep a list of those who test, only those who pass the class and receive their enhanced license,"" she said. ""We have started receiving applications and processing paperwork for the new enhanced licenses as of (Tuesday's) date.""

As of Jan. 31, there were 227,272 people with active concealed handgun licenses in Arkansas. The names of Arkansans with concealed carry permits are exempt from disclosure under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.

Of the students in Vaughn's standard and renewal concealed carry courses, he said probably 25 to 30 percent tell him they would like to get their enhanced licenses.

""Most of these people are not interested in carrying in bars under this if the bar or tavern allows it,"" he said. ""That is not what they are looking for. They are looking for the places they might be going to, say state offices. I haven't had hardly any people going to college do it yet — a few instructors or professors and that's it. People go out. People want to be able to protect themselves anywhere they might be. That is good.""

Logan Lee, who owns 141 Shooting Range in Bono, said the enhanced license is not for everyone, but it is a great way to justify more training because ""we have an obligation to responsibly use a weapon.""

Lee plans to offer his first enhanced license course on Feb. 24 to 28 students, and that course has been sold out for a while.

When it comes to training, he said, ""If you are a firearms instructor, you should be teaching on every level,"" and he encourages people with concealed carry licenses to take the enhanced licenses courses for the simple reason of receiving as much training as they can.

""I personally don't feel like the basic class is enough to be able to protect yourself,"" he said, adding he loves the expanded concealed carry law. ""It is a great opportunity for us to expand what we were doing and get more people the proper training they need. It gives people another avenue of training that they normally wouldn't do. People need incentives.""",2/15/2018,Jonesboro Sun
"A new dawn coming with 'enhanced' gun law
","A new dawn coming with 'enhanced' gun law 

Every day it seems that when you read, listen to or watch the news there is a heart-rending story of some sicko going into a gun-free zone and killing innocent people. We simply live in a society where this has been allowed to be a part of life, but it never should have become so, and it must stop. The proverbial page is turning, and it is going to turn on Arkansas on Jan. 1, courtesy of the Arkansas State Police.

Enhanced Conceal Carry will be enforced statewide beginning at the first of the year. This means that all areas deemed ""gun-free zones"" will be required by law to allow patrons who have completed Enhanced Conceal Carry courses to conceal carry their weapons there or detail in a letter to the Arkansas State Police how they plan to protect occupants should an active-shooter situation arise. This means everywhere, regardless if it is a university, college, high school, church, post office, bank, restaurant or any other area in the state.

The current concealed carry instructors will have to take new courses and must pass a stringent test before they can continue to teach concealed carry classes, and they must teach the Enhanced Conceal Carry classes. All of the details have not been ironed out as of presstime of this article, so no one knows for sure exactly what will be included in classes or training. Speculation is that the eight-hour course, which consists of six hours of classroom education and two hours of range time, will follow the guidelines of training that police officers receive in Arkansas at this time. We do know that participants of the courses will have to pass an accuracy test, and it is mandatory to qualify in this capacity or fail the course.

This is an attempt by the Arkansas State Police to ensure that qualified Enhanced Conceal Carry members have the ability to responsibly rationalize and accurately target an active shooter without putting innocent lives in jeopardy. It is my understanding that signs will be modified to say ""Gun-free zone except ECC permit holders.""

This may not be the perfect solution to the rising problem, but is a way to try to ensure that people visiting or working in a gun-free zone will not become the next set of statistics or list of latest victims. For the business owners or administrators who operate these facilities, it places the responsibility directly on their shoulders to allow ECC holders in or put into place a reasonable program of how they plan to protect their patrons, and it has to be approved by the Arkansas State Police.

It is a proven truth that the only thing that will stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun (this happened in the Texas church shooting a few weeks ago). So beginning at the first of the new year and forward from that point on, any sicko who is ticked off at the world and wants to cause pain to innocent people in Arkansas and who enters gun-free zones to kill people will find themselves looking down the barrel of a gun in the hands of a qualified person who has the ability and the responsibility to take them out.",12/10/2017,Jonesboro Sun
"New campus gun law presents risks to students
","New campus gun law presents risks to students

Sometime in early 2018 a few handgun carriers will be able to carry their hidden weapons almost anywhere on the campuses of Arkansas' state-supported colleges and universities, including classrooms and dormitories.

First they must complete eight hours of special training designed by the Arkansas State Police and taught by certified firearms instructors, including two hours of range qualification. They will have to pass a test to receive a so-called enhanced carry permit.

Hopefully, the training will be enough to keep them from getting between law enforcement officers and a bad guy carrying a gun. How the various parties will be able to tell the difference is unclear.

Act 562 became law Sept. 1, but ASP is still working on the training module. A public comment period on the proposed rules ended Nov. 10, and some firearms instructors expressed concerns especially about how to address the place of a licensee in an active shooter situation.

Generally, law enforcement officers are trained to shoot anybody with a gun in such situations. That won't work quite so well if you have a few ""good guys"" getting involved.

Consider the Dec. 10, 2015, incident on the Arkansas State University campus. A Jonesboro man, later convicted of terroristic threatening, drove his truck onto the lawn near the Student Union, brandishing a shotgun that he pointed at a propane tank.

Responding law enforcement officers were advised there were also several men dressed in black ninja costumes with guns near the building. It turned out that these were students filming a movie trailer, and they had no weapons, real or fake. They had no part in the terroristic threatening incident, but imagine what might have happened.

Even worse, what might happen if couple of concealed-carry permit holders confront such a suspect? Who starts shooting first?

We can thank Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, most of his legislative colleagues and Gov. Asa Hutchinson for bringing us the travesty and potential tragedy of Act 562. Collins sponsored the bill after previous legislation failed to convince higher education leaders that it was a good idea to allow guns on campus in the hands of people other than law enforcement officers.

Instead, lawmakers substituted their judgment for that of higher education administrators and board members, and the governor, who had argued against it, signed it. Collins' bill passed the House of Representatives 71-18, with nine not voting and two voting present. Earlier it passed had passed the Senate 18-9 with three voting present and four not voting.

All four Jonesboro representatives — Dwight Tosh, Jack Ladyman, Brandt Smith and Dan Sullivan — voted for the bill. Sen. John Cooper, who said he opposed it, did not vote.

A related law, Act 859 of 2017, restricts carrying concealed weapons at private colleges, teaching hospitals, collegiate athletic events, day-care facilities, bars or churches that choose not to allow them. However, the burden is on those who run such events and facilities to provide specific notices to that effect.

That leaves an awful lot of campus property that will be open for people who qualify to carry handguns, and administrators are limited in minimizing the risk.

Brad Phelps, Arkansas State University's chief counsel, said the Jonesboro campus has eight exempt spots under a private club clause in Act 562. That covers most athletic facilities, the Fowler Center and the Cooper Alumni Center. The NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine, housed in Wilson Hall, is also exempt.

Further, a licensee may not store a handgun in a residence hall or in a locked office or desk drawer. Handguns can be stored in a locked and unattended vehicle on campus.

Now here is the most foolhardy implication of Act 562: Licensees will be able to carry their handguns into a party at an on-campus fraternity or sorority house. While the new laws make exceptions to protect the adults allowed to drink legally in private clubs on campus, they do not protect students attending on-campus events where drinking is allowed for those of age.

I'm interested in this situation as a volunteer alumni adviser to an ASU fraternity, and several of us met recently with the university counsel to discuss what, if anything, we can do.

Our fraternity's national and local bylaws prohibit weapons of any kind in the fraternity house, which is owned by a private, nonprofit corporation. But Collins and Co. superceded those common-sense rules, too, with Act 562 because the house corporation leases the land on which the house is located from the university.

ASU's student conduct rules allow alcoholic beverages to be consumed by adult students in the fraternity houses during registered social events. The Greek organizations usually hire off-duty law enforcement officers to provide security, and they must abide by a long list of rules, including who may attend.

But the new law does not allow a fraternity to screen out people carrying guns. Monitors can't even ask whether an invited guest is carrying. The names of concealed carry permit holders are secret, thanks to another legislative edict, and they need only to show their enhanced license to a certified law enforcement officer.

Of course, many students who attend such functions are not old enough to drink, and most concealed carry permit holders are at least 21. But an organization will find it difficult to screen out people who are just carrying.

Young men, alcohol and guns: What could possibly go wrong?

"Draft out on program for hidden-guntoters - It calls for laws study, marksmanship tests","JONESBORO — The state will begin allowing concealed handguns on college campuses in 11 days.

Despite that law taking effect Sept. 1, Arkansas State University System spokesman Jeff Hankins said it is important for people to know ""we don't expect any actual changes regarding guns on campus until early 2018, when the Arkansas State Police-approved training is available.""

Approved earlier this year, Act 562 allows concealed carry permit holders who receive enhanced training to carry in public spaces, including public colleges and universities, and in private establishments like bars, restaurants and churches.

State Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, sponsored the measure. He has said his goal from the beginning was to keep loved ones safe on college campuses. A 2013 law left the decision up to public college and university administrators, but no campus opted to allow it.

The new law allows private establishments, including private colleges and universities, to opt out. Concealed handguns would still be banned from pre-K and K-12 schools, courtrooms and prisons.

An amendment was also added to exempt the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, state hospitals and college sporting events.

To be able to carry a weapon on campus, individuals must have a concealed carry license and complete additional training of up to eight hours for enhanced certification through the Arkansas State Police.

That enhanced certification is not currently offered. ASP spokeswoman Liz Chapman said Friday by email that lawmakers provided her agency an additional 120 days to ""promulgate rules applicable to the safety inspections and licensing.""

More than 220,000 people have concealed handgun licenses in Arkansas. The names of Arkansans with concealed carry permits are exempt from disclosure under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.

It is not yet known whether the names of those with the enhanced certification would also be exempt.

""At this time there is on-going internal discussions with ASP legal counsel and the Regulatory Division commander regarding the changes in rules and procedures that will have to occur in order to meet the statutory deadline,"" Chapman said. ""At this time it would be premature to discuss with you what may or may not eventually be drafted for consideration by the director, school officials or licensees.

In an email to campus constituencies last week, ASU System President Charles Welch said Arkansas State Police has indicated the enhanced training and certification will not be available until early 2018.

""Therefore, at this time no person other than law enforcement or security personnel may lawfully carry a weapon on any ASU System campus,"" he added.

With students returning to campus today, Welch said they have created a page on the ASU System website — http://www.asusystem.edu/about/policies/weapons/ — to provide questions and answers for faculty, staff and students.

The new webpage discusses what the new law allows and does not allow, as well as what individuals should do if they are aware of someone carrying or if they see a handgun and feel threatened.

""Your safety is very important, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure our campuses are safe for our faculty, staff, students and campus visitors,"" Welch said in the email. ""If you have any questions about this new law that are not addressed on the website, please do not hesitate to contact my office.""

The ASU System is currently operating under a weapons policy that states concealed weapons cannot be carried on campus. A new weapons policy is expected to be proposed next month to take the new law into account.

""We haven't finalized a decision on the timing of the new policy adoption,"" Hankins said. ""It could likely wait until the regular board meeting in September since the state police training guidelines won't be complete before then.""

""We continue to discuss security measures and haven't made final plans,"" he added on whether additional changes could be made due to the new law. ""Since the State Police-approved training likely won't be available until early 2018, there is not as much urgency.""",9/21/2017,Jonesboro Sun
"ASU to give guidance on new gun law next month
","JONESBORO — The start of classes is less than a month away, but incoming faculty, staff and students are not expected to see concealed carry weapons on campus for several more months.

Media instructor Ronald Sitton still hopes for instruction on how to proceed, sooner rather than later.

""I don't know that I am preparing any differently,"" Sitton said Monday, ""but I would like to know if there is something I need to add to my syllabus or some plan the university has that I need to follow or should I continue on my way and hope I am doing the right thing.

""... I would rather prepare than react any day. At least in my mind, if we tell the students this is what is going to happen and something does happen, they would at least have something to think about that they have been taught as a reaction and not go crazy.""

Approved earlier this year, Act 562 allows concealed carry permit holders who receive enhanced training to carry in public spaces, including public colleges and universities, and in private establishments like bars, restaurants and churches.

State Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, sponsored the measure. He has said his goal from the beginning was to keep loved ones safe on college campuses. Sitton does not believe it was needed.

""This idea that the Legislature thinks they know more than the people running the place seems a little stupid to me, especially since Arkansas State did a really good job both with the incident"" on Dec. 10, 2015, involving an active shooter situation and a false alarm months later.

Act 562 goes into effect Sept. 1, but Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said the Arkansas General Assembly gave his agency an additional 120 days to ""promulgate rules applicable to the safety inspections and licensing.""

Until then, the ASU Board of Trustees has reaffirmed a weapons policy that states concealed weapons cannot be carried on campus. It will remain in effect until Sept. 1. A new weapons policy is expected to be proposed next month to take the new law into account.

Both A-State spokesman Bill Smith and ASU System spokesman Jeff Hankins said discussion is already under way on how the university will move forward under the new law.

""As we do every year, guidance for our faculty and staff regarding new policies or procedures happens at new Faculty Orientation and the Faculty Conference,"" Smith said. ""Recognizing this issue's importance to our faculty, the provost is planning to have (ASU System general counsel) Brad Phelps present handouts and have discussions at these events related to the new law that goes into effect on Sept. 1.""

Sitton said a visit by Phelps to discuss what is allowed and what is not allowed ""would be really nice.""

""I'm a cop's son, so every semester I start out the class anyway saying, 'Hey, here are where the exits are, here's what happens if there were to be anything — God forbid there ever is — but if there were to be anything, and they come in the class, and we don't have a chance to leave, we are not going to sit here and be picked off,"" Sitton said. ""We are going to rush them.""

More than 220,000 people have concealed handgun licenses in Arkansas. The names of Arkansans with concealed carry permits are exempt from disclosure under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.

The new law still allows private establishments, including private colleges and universities, to opt out. Concealed handguns are also banned from pre-K, K-12 schools, courtrooms and prisons. An amendment was also approved following Act 562's passage to exempt the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, state hospitals and college sporting events.

""It makes it mighty hard to want to teach in Arkansas when you have to worry about whether someone has a gun in the classroom,"" Sitton said. ""I very well could be naive, and they have had them in there before in their backpacks. I would never have known.

""... The bigger issue is how are students going to feel about studying when they have to worry about who has guns in class. I don't have the answer to that.""",7/25/2017,Jonesboro Sun
"Re: Waylon Harris column on March 24, ""Campus carry, dangerous.""","In response to the above column, I would like the point out that the writer does not refer to any knowledge or experience with the training and requirements that are part of the Arkansas State Police syllabus that leads to the issuance of a concealed carry permit. Still he proceeds to judge a yet undeveloped state police training pro- gram. I would like Mr. Harris to take the state police concealed carry course and, being informed, write about that course.

The course I took emphasized that the CCH should not be emboldened by his possession of a gun, that it is wise to avoid situations that have potential for confrontation, strong emotional response or area of high crime. You do not show your weapon to control a situation. Bringing a weapon into the mix will most likely escalate the situation and increase the likely hood of violence. State police training requires the CCH to retreat/ back down as the CCH possesses access to deadly force. All trainees are warned of the consequences of shooting someone; there will be criminal, civil and psychological consequences; to be absolutely certain that the use of deadly force is the only alternative; all other options having failed!

I know a retired member of ASP, placing many under arrest, who says he never took his weapon out of the holster in response to a situation!

I want to assure Mr. Harris that whenIcarryorhaveagunitisnotfor his protection. If I receive an enhanced carry permit, I will not defend him.

The enhanced carry course is not yet developed so Mr. Harris is very premature in denigrating the training by assuming the course will create a class of vigilantes. Knowing that ""gun free"" zones are the preferred target

of deranged shooters, my guess is the course will address an active shooter situation giving the response for ECCH:

Do not go to the sound of gunfire as a vigilante responder.

If your weapon is visible you will be considered as a shooter/threat.

Leave the area, if an orderly an careful retreat is possible.

If retreat is not possible seek a defensive position and stay in place.

Comply with all instructions from security personnel.

ECCH do not have any special relationship with law/security officers.

Aside regarding open carry proponents: I hope they are granted open carry rights. I would appreciate them walking around with a virtual target on their back. They will be shot first. I appreciate their willingness to sacrifice themselves to warn me!",4/18/2017,Jonesboro Sun
NWACC board votes to ban guns - College uses last chance before new law,"JONESBORO — A new law authorizing the allocation of county revenue across both the eastern and western districts has done little to alleviate the concerns of state Sen. John Cooper, R-Jonesboro, he said Wednesday.

""It doesn't address everything that I was concerned about,"" Cooper told the Jonesboro Kiwanis Club on Wednesday. ""I think there's still some issues there. I think it only took a lot of the edge off of some of the issues, but it didn't deal with everything. My bill would've solved the problems. I don't think this one necessarily does.""

The law, which was filed as House Bill 1743 by Rep. Sarah Capp, R-Ozark, allows a county with multiple judicial districts to use revenue collected from those districts however its officials see fit, repealing a previous law limiting revenue raised in one district to be used in that district. Cooper filed Senate Bill 535, which would have eliminated operating procedures at the Lake City Courthouse. That bill failed to pass through the House Judiciary Committee after passing the Senate.

""It had a lot of political pressure from people in the eastern district,"" Cooper said of his bill. ""That happens in politics.""

Cooper continued to question the legality of the previous use of eastern district funds for all of Craighead County. He previously expressed concern over the adequacy of funds in the eastern district.

""I think it's important to understand that there was a situation here that was going on that's just against the law,"" Cooper said. ""Part of the thing that I was trying to do was fix the situation where government would be operated legally. (Capp's bill) just legalized what was illegal before.""

Cooper claimed western district municipalities ""heavily subsidized"" the eastern district, and said even with the new bill, questions still remain over the purpose of the eastern judicial district.

""We still have two judicial districts,"" Cooper said. ""All we've done is taken the funding language out of it. What's the purpose of that judicial district? If there's funding needed to go with that judicial district, how's that going to work now?""

Campus carry

Cooper also told the audience while he ultimately voted for an amended version of a bill authorizing concealed carry permit holders with enhanced training to carry guns on campuses of public universities, as well as private establishments such as bars and restaurants, he opposed the bill.

""I didn't like that gun bill when it started, and I don't like it much better today,"" Cooper said. ""I thought that bill should have never been filed. I'm a member of the (National Rifle Association). I hunt, own guns, but there's some things that you just don't need to do.""

Cooper expressed concern over the intensity of the NRA's lobbying for the bill and the number of amendments to the legislation.

""I got tired of voting that bill,"" Cooper said. ""It seems like every day we would come in there, there'd be another amendment on it, and it got to where you didn't know where you were because of all the amendments on it. You didn't know whether you were doing the right thing or not because you get so confused with all the amendments that's out there.""

Cooper said he voted for some of the amendments and for the amended version of the bill.

Government transparency

The 91st session of the state Legislature included a slew of bills aimed at adding exemptions to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. Gov. Hutchinson signed Senate Bill 12 into law recently, exempting personal information of public school resource officers, public university police forces, security personnel and emergency procedures from the FOIA, as well as other records and information that could be ""reasonably expected to be detrimental"" to public safety. A failed bill attempted to shield any information an individual or entity submits to their attorney as ""attorney-client communication.""

Cooper said he doesn't believe the Legislature is hiding from Arkansans.

""I don't think there's any intent to hide anything from the public,"" Cooper said.

Our world,"So, since it isn't 1881 anymore, shouldn't we be discussing things that affect us today? For example, there was no mention of people who had concealed carry permits — or any of the hundreds of different ""police"" authorities. Perhaps, because that was 1881 and this is 2017.

So, doing research to find something from 1881 is admirable, but I did some research and have determined that, loosely translating the information, there are about two reports a week of people having weapons stolen from unlocked vehicles.

Maybe, Sen. John Cooper can present a bill to make it a crime to leave

a weapon in an unsecured place. What if a child were to get inside

that vehicle? What if, heaven forbid, a criminal were to steal that weapon and commit a crime?

The mayor, a county police officer and countless civilians have all been reported losing a weapon from an unlocked vehicle. I think responsibility should be considered. I mean, do we really need a mayor who can't keep up with his weapon? A county police officer who can't? Just how secure are we with this kind of leadership?

But, if a police officer leaves his ""partner"" in a vehicle to die, it is OK. But if we take our four-legged kid with us we get in trouble, if they just think we allow them to get hot inside a vehicle.

If I kill a K9 officer, I am charged with the death of a police officer. If another police officer kills one, he doesn't even get a slap on the hand.

This is the world we have made.",3/30/2017,Jonesboro Sun
Gun bill achieves governor signature - Hutchinson calls it well-balanced,"JONESBORO — Gov. Asa Hutchinson has signed into law a measure allowing concealed handguns at public colleges and universities.

The new law allows anyone with a concealed carry license who receives enhanced training to carry in public spaces like government buildings and in private establishments like bars, restaurants and churches.

""The public should not be confused that everyone with a concealed carry weapon permit is going to be allowed to go into sensitive areas,"" Hutchinson said at a Wednesday news conference. ""That is not true. It is going to be a much more limited population, but they will be trained.

""Obviously, they will be trained in active shooter circumstances, how to coordinate with law enforcement. When that is done, I am convinced the public will be more safe. We will have more safety in our institutions and our public spaces.""

He said House Bill 1249, now Act 562, balances Second Amendment privileges and public safety.

Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, who filed HB1249, said his goal from the beginning has been to keep loved ones safe on college campuses because a government profile showed anyone planning a school shooting were ""plotters"" who researched before acting.

""The one thing they cannot do is plan for a good guy or a good gal with a gun who might interdict their plan,"" Collins said at the news conference. ""So, I believe what we are doing here is increasing the safety of Arkansas by deterring some of these crazy killers from choosing to go to our campuses and potentially murder people.""

The bill initially was filed to allow faculty and staff with licenses to carry handguns on campus, but it underwent a series of changes as lawmakers debated age restrictions and training requirements.

The measure that became law allows anyone with a license to receive an endorsement from the Arkansas State Police if he or she completes a one-time, eight-hour training course. Up to four hours of that training could be waived based on prior training received within the past 10 years.

More than 220,000 people have concealed handgun licenses in Arkansas. The names of Arkansans with concealed carry permits are exempt from disclosure under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.

The National Rifle Association endorsed the measure. At the news conference, Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said, ""This step goes a long way toward recognizing law-abiding people in this state have the right to defend themselves anywhere they have a legal right to be.""

A 2013 law left the decision to public colleges and universities, but no campus opted to allow concealed handguns on school property. University leaders opposed the new measure.

""While we have expressed concerns regarding the bill, we recognize the General Assembly has spoken, and we will begin preparations to comply with the law when it goes into effect this fall,"" Arkansas State University System President Charles Welch said in a statement.

A lawmaker whose district includes the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville called the law ""horrifying,"" and noted it even allows concealed guns at Razorback football games and other sporting events in government-owned facilities.

""People like to have a good time before the game, during the game, people get emotional and angry during the game,"" Democratic Rep. Greg Leding said. ""I think the idea of introducing loaded weapons into those situations is just ridiculous.""

The measure was condemned by gun control advocates.

""This legislation will make everyday life in Arkansas more dangerous,"" Austin Bailey, the Arkansas chapter leader of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said in a statement.

But, the new law does include some restrictions. It allows private establishments as well as private colleges and universities to opt out of allowing weapons by posting a written notice.

Concealed handguns are still banned at K-12 schools, courtrooms and prisons. The new law does not cover federal government buildings.

In addition, Hutchinson said concealed handguns will not be allowed in a student dorm, residence hall or disciplinary hearings on campuses.

Senate President Jonathan Dismang has filed legislation to address some concerns about the new law. He said his proposal to exempt the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the state hospital has been advanced by a Senate committee. The proposal also removes the requirement that private colleges post a notice if they don't allow concealed handguns.

The new law will take effect Sept. 1, although individuals with concealed handguns are not likely to receive the needed endorsement to carry in the expanded locations until next year. The law gives Arkansas State Police until January to design the additional training that will be required.",3/23/2017,Jonesboro Sun
