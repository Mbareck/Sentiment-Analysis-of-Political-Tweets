Governor hopeful says gun law is 'disaster',"FAYETTEVILLE - Arkansas' enhanced-carry gun law is a ""disaster,"" said Republican gubernatorial candidate Jan Morgan.

After addressing about 40 people at a meeting of the Republican Women of Washington County group at San Miguel Mexican Grill & Bar on Tuesday, Morgan briefly butted heads with state Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, who sponsored the bill that became Act 562 of 2017.

The law allows people with ""enhanced"" carry licenses to take concealed handguns onto public university campuses and into other public spaces.

""I'm sorry that you feel that the enhanced-carry program is good and is good for the people of the state because it is a disaster,"" said Morgan, who owns a gun range in Hot Springs. ""I'm refusing to teach it. I'm refusing to take the test. It's 30 pages of additional restrictions.""

The bill itself was nine pages, but the Arkansas State Police revised ""syllabus for enhanced training"" is 25 pages.

Collins, who was sitting on the front row, had repeatedly asked Morgan if she would have vetoed the bill if she was governor.

Morgan said the bill never would have happened under her leadership.

""Under my leadership, there's not going to be a bully pulpit, bullying Republican legislators to act and vote like Democrats,"" she said.

Morgan said she would make sure Arkansans know about the bills that are coming before the Legislature.

""The people are going to stay on your back and say, 'This is what we want,' and if you fail them, you're going to answer to them, not to a governor who twisted your arm and said if you don't vote the way I say, you're going to have a primary opponent, and I'm going to fund them with Asa PAC money,"" she said, referring to Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

""It's unfair to say somebody twisted my arm because they didn't,"" responded Collins. ""You didn't twist it, and he didn't twist it.""

Morgan said the enhanced-carry legislation needs to be tossed and the state needs to go back to ""constitutional carry."" She said ""Arkansas is a constitutional-carry state.""

""Constitutional carry means you don't have to get that permission slip from the state,"" she said.

Morgan said the enhanced-carry bill ""tells you that it's OK to consume alcohol and carry a gun.""

""That flies in the face of what I teach,"" she said. ""It tells you you can carry on a college campus, but you cannot carry anywhere where a disciplinary action might be discussed. Well, that could be anywhere.

""These are the kinds of issues with that enhanced-carry bill. I'm wondering did you really read it before you put it out there?""

Morgan said other legislators told her their ""arms were twisted"" by Hutchinson to vote in a manner she deemed to be ""like Democrats.""

Afterward, Collins said he never got a straight answer from Morgan on whether she would have signed his bill or vetoed it, and she was making an issue of voting transparency during her speech.

""The way things are operating today in the state of Arkansas, I would submit to you we have constitutional carry,"" said Collins. ""There are many places where our concealed-carry law prevents you from carrying, that are prohibited by law. College campuses is one. The state Capitol is another. Bars are another.

""The enhanced carry says if you get this additional eight hours of training, which is two hours of shooting training as well as six hours of in-class instruction, including an active-shooter situation, then you'll be able to carry in a much wider range of places, including the state Capitol and college campuses and bars. It does not authorize you to be drunk and disorderly. It does not authorize you to be drunk with a weapon, but you can go in a bar.""

Morgan is challenging Hutchinson in the May 22 Republican primary. The winner of the Republican primary faces the winner of the Democratic primary - either Jared Henderson of Little Rock or Leticia Sanders of North Little Rock - and Libertarian Mark West of Batesville in the Nov. 6 general election. Hutchinson is in his first four-year term.",3/29/2018,Malvern Daily Record
Quorum Court discusses concealed carries and full time officers,"The Hot Spring County Quorum Court met on Tuesday, March 13 at the HSC Courthouse at 6 p.m. At the meeting, Justices of the Peace met to vote on upcoming bills. One bill was under consideration concerning courthouse employees being allowed to carry concealed weapons on county grounds. Employees would have to have a concealed carry license, and would still have to adhere to laws banning concealed carries in courtrooms, jails, and other locations which would be detailed in a concealed carry class.

Justice of the Peace, Don Hillyard, brought up specialized training as well as recurring training. The Chief Deputy brought up the option for a special active shooter training that would protect court employees and prevent confusion in the event of an active shooter.

County Attorney Ralph Ohm, when asked about the legality of such a bill, said that it was perfectly legal, save for bringing guns into restricted areas (jail, courtroom, etc). Though, he strongly suggested court employees participate in active shooter training. In a small poll performed by the Chief Deputy, 21 court employees gave their opinion on the option of employees carrying concealed weapons. Of the 21, 18 were in support, two were against and one gave no opinion. Of the JPs in attendance, all but one, Justice of the Peace Jewell Willis, voted yes to this bill.

There was one resolution to debate as well on whether or not the HSC Quorum Court would consider hiring a full time resource officer for each school in the district. The court resolved to consider it in the budget for the upcoming school year. Each school would be approached with the same proposition.

There was another bill passed regarding Hot Spring County joining the Southwest Arkansas Intermodal Authority. A representative was there to welcome Hot Spring County.",3/15/2018,Malvern Daily Record
Changes in concealed carry permits - Capitol Review with,"LITTLE ROCK - The Arkansas State Police is working on changes to concealed carry regulations to enforce the intent of Acts 562 and 859, which the legislature approved earlier this year. Act 562 expands the number of locations where a permit holder can legally carry a concealed firearm, such as public facilities. In order to legally carry in those additional locations, the owner of the firearm must complete additional training to obtain an enhanced license.

Permit holders who maintain the traditional non-enhanced will continue to be prohibited from carrying a concealed firearm in public buildings, schools, colleges, universities, churches, bars and at parades that require a permit.

A person who obtains an enhanced permit can legally carry on public colleges and universities. However, even with an enhanced permit it will be prohibited to carry concealed firearms at collegiate sporting events such as football games. Also, it will be prohibited to carry at the State Hospital or the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Also, a student with an enhanced concealed carry may not store a firearm in his or her dormitory room.

Several areas will remain prohibited, even for holders of enhanced carry permits. Those locations include prisons, courtrooms and public schools from kindergarten through grade 12. There are allowances for school security guards to carry firearms, and private schools can allow permit holders to carry on school grounds.

Churches and bars can allow or prohibit the carrying of firearms on their premises. They can post a written notice, or verbally notify the permit holder that firearms are not permitted.

At a public hearing conducted by the State Police there were questions from instructors, who train applicants in the use of firearms and teach them on the rules that specify where the carry of concealed firearms remains prohibited.

The State Police will accept written comments until 4 p.m. on November 10. The proposed regulations that will implement Acts 562 and 859 can be found on the State Police web site at the address of its Administrative and Regulatory Division: http://asp.ark.org/publications/

The page has a list of bulleted items and the top item is: ""Notice of Proposed Rules Changes -Arkansas Concealed Handgun Licensing."" If you click on it, it opens onto the proposed regulations.

After the State Police compiles the public comments and any changes in the new rules, it will submit them to the legislature's Administrative rules and Regulations Subcommittee for consideration at its December meeting.

About 225, 000 people in Arkansas have a concealed carry permit and there are about 1, 000 instructors.

Educational Adequacy The Senate Education Committee voted to make two revisions to the adequacy report that lawmakers will use in the 2018 fiscal session as the basis for deciding how much state aid to distribute to public schools. They are to add about $2 million for special education catastrophic funding and $3 million for transportation funding.

The adequacy recommendation for Fiscal Year 2019 is to increase the per pupil foundation rate to $6, 781, making the total of state aid to schools more than $3 billion.

Under the state Constitution, the state has the duty to provide an adequate education to all children in the state, regardless of the relative prosperity of the district in which they live.",11/4/2017,Malvern Daily Record
"Campuses take steps during gun-law wait - Enhanced carry won't happen without special training, which hasn't been created","Concealed carry weapons are coming to Arkansas' college campuses, but their lawful carry will be delayed somewhat.

University of Arkansas Chancellor Joseph Steinmetz recently reminded the campus community in Fayetteville that a pair of new state laws (Acts 562 and 859) go into effect on Sept. 1.

The laws can't be fully implemented, however, until the Arkansas State Police creates the necessary training for an ""enhanced"" certification to carry a concealed weapon. And, the first candidates must secure those permits before they may lawfully take a gun to campus.

The certification requirement is part of the controversial legislation successfully championed by state Rep. Charlie Collins, R-Fayetteville, in the last regular legislative session.

He had been trying for years to get the Legislature to authorize concealed carry on campus (as it has in other public places). With strong backing from the National Rifle Association, he got the law passed on his latest attempt.

The requirement for up to eight hours of enhanced training came with it.

The Arkansas State Police must develop the training program that is intended to equip qualifying enhanced permit-holders to deal with an active-shooter scenario.

The State Police have 120 days after the effective date of the law to design the program. Bill Sadler, spokesman for the agency, expects State Police will take every one of those 120 days to sign off on a certification program.

And, he said, the whole process could take longer, since the newly promulgated rules may require legislative review, too.

Plus, the people the State Police authorize to do the training for concealed carry must be trained themselves on the enhanced certification. Then and only then can any candidate take the training and get certified to carry a weapon on campus.

There's another challenge, too.

Remember how the law was amended to keep sports fans from carrying weapons into a stadium or other arena?

Concealed carry at sporting events may only be prohibited if the institution has an approved security plan in place for the venue.

The process and requirements are still being worked out for such plans. And the planning gets complicated when they're trying to secure, say, a golf course or a cross-country race route, not just a closed-in stadium or arena.

So there's good reason for expecting a delay in implementation of the new laws.

That delay is also the source of considerable relief for those who never really wanted to see more guns on college campuses - unless they're in the hands of trained police officers.

But thanks to Charlie Collins and other supporters, the delay is only temporary.

Eventually, the security plans will be made and approved. The enhanced certification process will be cleared and the training made available. And there will be plenty of people who seek the permits, including many who truly believe as Collins does that they'll be making the campuses safer for all.

Others still worry about the mere presence of guns and the potential for their misuse, unintended or otherwise.

While the debate about guns on campus won't ever be over, Arkansas law will allow them to be there.

The University of Arkansas, like the other campuses in the state, is wisely preparing for the change.

Chancellor Steinmetz' email to students last week explained the coming changes and promised notice to the campus when the permit process actually is complete and full implementation begins.

In the meantime, the university is offering an online resource to answer questions and further explain the new concealed carry laws.

Check out www.safety.uark.edu for information, including frequently asked questions from the perspective of students, faculty, staff, parents and visitors to the campus.

The site details the law and makes it clear, among other things, that ""concealed"" means concealed.

Anyone with the necessary permit must keep a weapon, even a holstered gun, concealed except in a life-threatening situation. Weapons must be somewhere completely out of sight.

The university suggests someone who sees a weapon being displayed should report it to campus police. If it is being displayed in a threatening manner, the call should go to 911.

""Carry"" also means carry at the university. The only place on campus a weapon may be stored is in a locked and unattended motor vehicle on university or public property. Nowhere else. Not in a locker, a filing cabinet, a locked car.

One other point jumps out from the university guidelines. The law will be strictly enforced.

Not only are those who violate the new state laws subject to legal action under the laws themselves, university employees who violate them may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Students, too, could face disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the university.

Of course, no one needs worry for a while yet. Implementation of the new state laws is months away.",8/16/2017,Malvern Daily Record
"Talking concealed carry at the Lions Club
Talking concealed carry at the Lions Club
","Assistant Chief Jim Bailey, with the Malvern Police Department, visited the Malvern Lions Club on Tuesday, April 25 to give a little bit of information on Arkansas' concealed carry laws.

He said there's been a lot of confusion due to changes in the laws being drafted at state level. Rumors and fake news on social media further confuse the issue.

One issue he addressed was websites offering online concealed carry permit classes. Bailey said no one can get a legal concealed permit off the Internet in Arkansas, classes must be attended in person.

He said concealed carry in Arkansas started in about 2005. At the beginning, concealed carry permit owners could only use their Arkansas permits in about four or five other states. At the time, Arkansas law stipulated that it would only honor out of state concealed carry licenses from states that did the same for Arkansas.

That law has been relaxed and Arkansas concealed carry licenses now apply for most states.

The time to complete the course varies. Previously, the classes required eight hours. If participants finished in three, they killed time for the remaining five hours. The time limit was since removed, said Bailey. For a small class of just two people, it might only take three hours. Larger classes are likely to take eight.

One of the tests involves shooting at a distance of 30 feet, the average length of a hallway. Bailey said over 80 percent of confrontations happen within nine feet.

Bailey has been teaching concealed carry classes since 2009. He said his average student is between 35 and 50, and probably about 40 percent are female. He said the Arkansas State Police website provides a page for users to find nearby instructors.

He said if a person comes in contact with an officer and they have a handgun within reach, they are required to inform the officer and hand over their concealed carry licenses with their drivers licenses.

Guns must be secured when there are children around.",4/27/2017,Malvern Daily Record
